# Intro

I'm currently 3000 feet above the ground with no parachute. But you know what? I don't give a fuck. 

Every day, hundreds of millions of people suffer from giving too many fucks. They spend their lives in prison with meaningless anxiety and unnecessary concerns. But it doesn't have to be that way. In this video, I'm going to walk you through the five levels of non fuck giving. Each level demonstrates more non-fuckery than the last. You will learn step by step how to face your fears, how to stop worrying about what other people think, and how to achieve the eternal bliss of fuckless life.

But it's not enough to simply learn how to not give a fuck,  you have to live it. You have to embody your non fuckery. So to illustrate each of these life lessons, I flew out to Atlanta and met with a fan named Garrett. Now Garrett had specifically told me that he gave too many fucks in his life, and so I enlisted his best friend Alex. And together, we paused him through five life-changing challenges. That purged him of all necessary fuck-giving. In the beginning, he was meek and shy, but by the end, I had him jumping out of planes, asking out models, and of course, dressing like a fucking chicken. Let's get your beaks ready motherfuckers' cause class is in.

# Nobody Cares

In psychology, there's something known as the spotlight effect. Now the spotlight effect says that we all tend to assume that people are paying more attention to us than they actually are. Think back to the last time you got a terrible haircut. Chances are you walked around all day assuming that everybody was staring at that tragedy of a mop on your head. But the reality was most people didn't notice. And if they noticed, they sure didn't care. 

One of my favorite quotes ever comes from the author David Foster Wallace. He said, "You will stop worrying so much about what other people think about you when you realize how **seldom**(not often) they do." As someone who grew up with a lot of social anxiety, this idea was absolutely profound to me. But the problem is the idea by itself is not **sufficient**(enough, adequate). You have to get out into the world and experience it.  You have to get out and challenge your own spotlight effect. Now, does that mean you have to put on a chicken suit and walk down the Venice Boardwalk? No, of course not. But it does mean you have to do something. You have to challenge yourself. You have to put yourself into public and into uncomfortable situations and prove to yourself conclusively that nobody's paying attention and nobody gives a shit. That is what I did with Garrett, and I guarantee you he hated every single second of it.

# Level 1 (Embarrassment) 

Tolerating embarrassment is the bedrock of not giving a fuck, so I had my team design and print 50 Flat Earth flyers. Garrett's challenge was to hand them all out in public.  The goal is to destroy his inner spotlight effect. The fact actually believes that kind of stuff too is dope.

//Ignore conversations

Surveys show that the one thing that people are more afraid of than death is public **humiliation**. 

//Ignore conversations

Part of not giving a fuck is overcoming that evolutionary conditioning. Training yourself. You're not gonna die. If you embarrass yourself, if people laugh at you, the crowd doesn't want to go the way you go, nothing's gonna happen. Do you know why? 'Cause nobody's fucking thinking about you. Everybody is busy thinking about their own shit and worrying about themselves. They don't care what you're doing. 

//Ignore conversations and ads
# Level 2(Rejection)

If the willingness to look like an idiot is the bedrock of not giving a fuck, the next step is to be willing to face rejection. And what better rejection than romantic rejection? It's one thing to not care what strangers think, but what about people you actually care about? Are you willing to say things that your friends and family might not approve of? Are you comfortable having difficult conversations? Are you afraid to embarrass yourself on a date? This is so ridiculous. Most of us tie up our self-esteem and our romantic successes and failures. I'm just like constantly trying to hang on. 

But that's why I made Garrett go on dates with 10 professional models while asking them the most awkward and uncomfortable questions possible. 

//Ignore conversations

So I have to interrupt this relationship segment for just a second to explain something. 


You Get to to Choose

There are two ways to approach your relationships. Performance and authenticity. People like Garret who give way too many fucks, tend to see the relationships in terms of performance. They view every social situation in terms of "What do I say or do to get people to like me?". And then they try to say or do that. 

Garret: Did you play any sports? 
Model 3: I personally train people at the gym so...
Garret: Really?
Model 3: Yeah
Garret: I actually have a friend that does something similar to that. 

This is a terrible way to live, for a bunch of reasons.  

The first is just that it's incredibly stressful. I mean, every social interaction basically becomes like an exam at school where you have to say and do the exact right things to get the result. But the real reason is that it prevents you from having healthy relationships in the first place. Even if you do perform in the right way and get people to like you, you will never fully trust that they like you for you.

What comes after that? Oh, that's it, right? 

Once you've been rejected romantically enough times, you realize there's no reason to protect yourself and no reason to be afraid of criticism. 

# Level 3(Criticism)

The big breakthrough for most people comes when they finally drop the performance and embrace authenticity. Because of performance guarantees that you're gonna feel rejected eventually, you might as well get rejected for who you already are. This is what happens when you start approaching relationships with authenticity, by being unapologetic in who you are and living with the results. By realizing that you don't have to wait around for people to choose you, you can also choose them. 

Garret seemed to start to understand this about halfway through his dates with the models, he started to realize he didn't have to make every girl like him. In fact, he can decide if he likes the girl, and this simple switch changes everything. 

// Ignore conversations

leaves room for improvement

You're cool as a cucumber now. 冷静的像黄瓜，镇定自若，泰然处之。

Something incredible happens when you stop giving a fuck about other people's opinions about you. It gives you the freedom to fail. All those things you've been curious about, all those adventures you've dreamed of but been too scared to **pursue**, it all suddenly opens up to you because the people who previously got in your way aren't there anymore. 

// Ignore conversations

Most people are afraid to try something new because they don't wanna be bad at something. But the fact of the matter is, you can't be good at something until you're terrible at it first. 

// Ignore break dance teaching 

Most of us are two results-oriented and not enough process-oriented, and I think a lot of this comes from the way we're raised. You grow up and you're rewarded for getting an A on the test or getting a gold star at the activity. Everything is about "Can you achieve this result? And then we will reward you." He's doing the whole thing, boom. But the fact of the matter is life doesn't actually work that way. In fact, in many ways, life rewards the willingness to fail, life rewards the person who is willing to embarrass themselves a little bit, who's willing to take some risks. 

Garret is **bonafide perfectionist**. He's one of those people who will not try to do something unless he knows he can do it perfectly and so step four is to get him to be bad at something. 

# Level 4(Failure)

To show him that there's joy in the process of learning, of improving, of developing a new skill set. So I ask you, what are you unapologetically bat at?  What are you more than happy to be terrible at because it brings so much joy to your life? If you can't answer that easily, well, then that's probably a fucking problem. 

That night in the nightclub, as Garret danced the way elderly people fuck, I realized that he was tasting for the first time the sweet, sweet internal freedom that comes from not giving a fuck. He felt zero pressure, zero regret. He wanted to dance, so he went and danced. 

# Level 5 (Zero Fucks Given)


Up until this point, I've been primarily challenging Garret to embarrass himself in front of strangers. But what if we turn that around? What if we took Garrett's newfound internal freedom, his surmounting of his doubts and insecurities, and used his newfound superpower to help others overcome their doubts and insecurities as well? After all, emotions are contagious, and once we've liberated ourselves from imagined constraints, it's our moral duty to help liberate other people from theirs. 

So I brought Garrett back to a crowded shopping center and challenged him to convince a stranger to go skydiving with us. But you have to do it wearing a chicken suit.
