# Intro

Now, learning has been probably one of my main superpowers, since I was very young. And learning  how to learn is one of those meta skills. That no one really teaches us. But that can have an enormous impact on our life. In basically that everything we do.

For example, when I was in med（这里应该是 middle） school, I learned how to learn and therefore I could study for everything that I was doing more efficiently and that freed up my own time to do things like set up a business and set up YouTube Channel and these days even though I don't have many more exams to prepare for, learning is still a huge part of my life. Trying to get better at making these Youtube videos, trying to get better at running a business. All of these stuff involves learning.

And so in this video, I'm gonna share 9 tips that I found really helpful that are evidence-based about how we can learn anything we want faster, let's go.

# Sharpen the axe（磨刀不误砍柴工）

Tip number one is sharpen the axe.

Now this is from a quote that's attributed to Abraham Lincoln（林肯）. Where he famously said that—— If you give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.

And he‘s really talking here about the power of preparation. This definitely applies to learning anything as well. Let's say we are studying for an exam and we wanna learn it a little bit better, reading a great book called "Make It Stick" would be a great way of learning how to learn or <del>checking out my Skillshare class on evidence-based study techniques</del>.

Equally, let's say we're trying to learn something like the guitar or chess or anything like that. Something that's not related to studying. We should still spend a decent amount of time figuring out the meta learning behind what we're actually gonna learn like how we are going to learn the thing.

For example, when I was learning how to play the piano by ear, I spent a decent amount of time on the learn piano subreddit where people explaining how to learn, how to play piano by ear. And just spending a little bit of time sharpening the axe, before I actually sat down to learn the thing really helped **accelerate** my learning process.

# Use crutches to optimise focus（使用合适的方式优化注意力，例如五分钟法则）

>  As verbs the **difference** between **optimise** and **optimize**
>
> is that **optimise** is (british) (**optimize**) while **optimize** is (originally|intransitive) to act optimistically or as an optimist.

Tip number two is use **crutches** to **optimise** our focus. 

Now, whenever we're learning anything, It's really **tempting** to kind of learn in the backgroud, like practicing the guitar while watching TV or something like that. But obviously, when we're full focused on the thing that we're learning, our brain learns the thing a lot better. And so I found a few different crutches or hacks that have been particularly helpful in helping me focus on things.

One is *the 5-minute rule* which is general tip for productivity as well. Which is that if we wanna do something and we're finding ourselves have difficulty in starting out doing the thing, like actually getting started, overcoming the **activation** energy. The 5-minute rule says that, we just have to **convince** ourselves that we're just gonna do the thing for five minutes. And then after we're done it for five minutes. We're allowed to just not do it, but more often than not, I find that if I've been practicing the guitar, playing the piano for five minutes. I do then want to actually continue to practise. 其实有点像 《Atomic Habits》里面说的，我只做两分钟。

The other thing that's really helpful, just chuck my phone away. I literally take my phone and I **tose** it onto the sofa or on the floor like a good tosser. 

And then I'm really to focus and not be **distracted** with the thing that I'm trying to learn, all right?

扔掉手机，五分钟法则。但是，我不玩手机，没有意思。五分钟法则对我也不是特别有用。

# Find opportunities for immersion（找到任何沉浸下去的机会）

Tip number three is to find opportunities for **immersion**.

名字叫做《超速学习》[中文宣传视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi4wLTxGZc0) 

So there's a great book called "Ultralearning" by a chap called Scott H Young. Where he talks about his journey through learning  languages in like three months at a time and becoming fluent in a language in three months. And the key to that as all language learners say is immersion. Just being as immersed in the language as possible.

**And the general principle here is that we learn best when we in we're in the environment where we're actually gonna be using the skill**. So, for example, when I was learning how to do magic to become a close-up magician, yes I was doing some practices in front of my webcam and in front of my mirror just to get the slight of hand down. But really my webcam or mirror is not the **arena** in which I'm gonna be performing in. And so I made a point to try and perform magic for real people as much as possible. I would take a deck of cards to school and I'd have cards in my room at all times, and so friends would come over, I kind of, hey, be like, hey do you wanna see a magic trick? And eventually once I got okay at performing for friends and family, I started then reaching out and doing paid **gigs**, even though I was nowhere near good enough in my head to get paid to do magic. Eventually, I did end up getting paid to do magic. And those walk around to gig at balls and parcties helped improve my abilities in a way that just doing it in front of mirror really wouldn't have done.  

找到任何机会，找到那个环境去勤加练习，时时刻刻准备着。

# Figure out what your weak links are

Tip number 4 is to figure out what are our weak links and the use a lot of drills and stuff to improve them. 

So if we use med school as an example,  I have few subjects that I was pretty weak in. Neurology was one of them. If you'd asked me what is Guillain-Barré syndrome. I'd have been like, oh God, I have absolutely no idea. 

I didn't have a mental module for where it would fit into the subject of neurology. So when I came to studying efficiently for my exams, I knew that, okay, I have to drill the things that I'm weakest on. And I spend just a whole day, basically creating a one-page **syllabus** of just neurology, just focusing on that one subject. And just because I spent like eight to 12 hours that day they're doing it. I basically plugged it as an area of weakness, and that it was no longer an area of weakness. And the question I would keep on asking myself every day when I was sitting down to stus was, If exam were tomorrow, what topic would I be the least happy, or the most pissed off about?

And then I would just study that topic. And( so many and !!!) this is really good because whenever we're learning or whenever we're studying or anything like that,  it's very tempting to just do the stuff that seems familiar to us. If we're stuying for exam it's very tempting to open up the book to page one      and just even though we already know what's on page one.

If we learning guitar, it's very tempting to just play through songs that we're already played before. But really the learning only happens when we're trying to fix our weaknesses and we're trying to operate at a decent level of difficultly.

If something is too easy, we're not gonna learn anything at all. And so if we wanna maximise the learning and learning anything faster, so we wanna really hone down on what are these areas of weakness, what are there weak links,  and how do we use drills to improve those as quickly as we can?

找到你的弱处，不断的练习，当然，不能找你认为太容易的，这样没有提升，我也不建议找太难的，找到 a decent level of difficultly.

Figure out your weaknesses, then drills a lot. You shouldn't do easy things for you, you're not gonna learn anything at all. And you shouldn't do a lot higher level things for you, you should operate at a decent level of difficultly.

# Test yourself

Tip number 5 is to test ourselves.

Now, this is a thing that in the world of studying is called active recall, but also applies to the world of learning anything in general. I have a whole video about that, <del>that's linked in the card over there. And if you wanna find out more, you can definitely chek out my Skillshare course about how to study for exams, also linked in the video description, by the way Skillshare is sponsoring this video. I'll tell you more about them a little bit later. </del> 

Anyway, the idea behind active recall or **retrieval** practise is that we don't learn by trying to put stuff in our brains, we actually learn **counter-intulively** by trying to take stuff out of our brains. And so if you've had that experience where you've read something in a textbook or on a website and someone asks you about it a few days later and you've completely forgotten about it, that's just because you haven't tested yourself on that knowledge. And the word testing has all these negative **connotations** because we think of testing as like a school thing, and we get graded and we get judged.

But if we move towards thinking of testing ourselves as being a strategy for learning, everything become so much easier. That's why when learning play the guitar there's only so many tutorials as you can watch before you actually start having to put it into practise. When you studying for exams, there'e no point reading the textbook and just summarising what's in the textbook, the point is you have to test yourself so that your brain has a chance to work to retrieve the information. And that is what really drives learning. And in the field of learning, there is this concept called *the desirable difficultly concept*. 合适的，可取的难度概念

Which basically just means some things shouldn't be too hard where for example if I  were to try tennis  against Roger Federer, It would just be too hard. I wouldn't be learn anything. But equally, if I were to try playing tennis against a 10 year old who doesn't know how to play, it wouldn't be fun, I wouldn't learn anything. Because the difficulty is a two different **extremes**. I wanna be playing tennis against someone who is at my level or a little bit better than me, because that is the real arena in which I'm gonna be learning. And that's why having a coach for example, is really good, because a coach can moderate their play style to be at my level and therefore I'm more likely to learn as desirable difficultly.

And so whatever we wanna learn efficiently we wanna apply this concept to try and make it a little bit more difficult. Learning is not supposed to be easy, it supposed be hard. And if it's hard, then it means we're doing something right.

其实有点跳出舒适圈的味道。

**Roger Federer** is a Swiss professional tennis player. He is ranked No. 8 in the world by the Association of Tennis Professionals. He has won 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles, an all-time record shared with Rafael Nadal.

拿出和你当前水平持平或者高于你一点点的问题去测试你自己。太难会不想做，太容易也是。

# Get intense Feedback often

Tip number six is to get intense feedback as often and as quickly as possible. 

So feedback obviously is how we learn. We do something, we see that doing it wrong, and then we improve the thing. And again, feedback is one of those words that can seem a little bit like dirty at time especially if we're starting something out where we're not sure of our own abilities. If we get constructive or critical feedback, that can really be a blow to our ego. If you're that sort of person that needs to ego message then at the start of learning something, what you need is praise and **encouragement**. For example, if I was just starting to learn how to sing, and people just give me critical feedback immediately, I probably feel a little bit like, oh, okay I don't really wanna sing. I'm one of those people who just can't sing. Equally if I were to start drawing and people would be like oh, haha! that's really crap you should do this instead. 

I probably feel pretty bad about it and therefore it wouldn't help me continue on the journey. So I think at the start of journey for most of us we need that injection of positivity and **enthusiasm** rather than necessarily critical feedback. But if we do decide to switch gears and to start taking learning something super seriously, we wanna kind of avoid the praise and recognition aspect of it, which is kind of unhelpful, and instead focus on the critical, constructive feedback. What can we do differently?

Again, this is why having a coach for stuff is actually really, really helpful. Ever since getting a personal trainer, everything in the gym has improved, my **biceps** has gotten bigger. I'm one-step close to becoming a gym shark athlete becasue now I have someone who is like there and then giving me feedback on the things that I should do differently.

Whereas before maybe once in a blue moon, I'd film a video of myself, send it to a friend, they've reply a few days later. It's not really a tight feedback loop. And really it's the tight feedback loops that encourage learning whether it's for exams or whether it's for anything else in life.

# Overlearning

Tip number seven is the concept of overlearning.

Which is that when we're learning something we actually wanna try and understand or learn it in more depth than we necessarily need to. And the idea here is to continuously be asking why a thing works the way that it dose. 

So for example, when I'm working as a doctor and I see senior doctors who, you know, most of being a doctor, **admittedly** is about following guielines and following a **prescribed** set of rules basically a flow chart for everything that we do. And so there some doctors who have that view of  you know all I have to do is memorise the guidelines, and look them up, but then there are other doctors who have a more first principles understanding approach to medicine which is that, okay, I know what the guidelines are, I should prescribe this drug, but I'm actually gonna take a step to figure out what that's guideline and why do they do that? What's the paper, what's the evidence around this.

And, you know, in my experience, it's hard to say that camp two is objectively a better doctor than camp one, but certainly the sort of doctor that I want to be is the doctor who understands stuff from first principles and understands the **rationale** for doing stuff rather than just memorising the guidelines. This applies to music theory in the guitar as well. I had a guitar in this morning, and we were talking about how it's very easy to learn how to play anything by just following a tutorial.

But when you follow a tutorial, the thing that you're learning is, my fingers are going in this particular position. Whereas what we wanna try and get to, and John Mayer talks about this a lot on his Instagram, what we wanna be getting to is just an understanding of music theory. So instead of I put my fingers in A, B and C positions, we think, okay, I'm playing a C7 chord(和弦 ) and the reason I'm playing a C7 chord is because of this. And therefore my fingers are gonna go in A, B and C position.

And so the end result is the same. We're still playing that chord and we could still probably just play the song. But when you have that deeper **apreciation** of the reasons behind why things are the way that they are, it just make learning anything else in that particular sphere, much easier and much more efficient.

一直一直重复。变成肌肉记忆。

# Spacing(每隔一段时间回想自己学的东西)

Tip number eight is all about spacing.

This is something in the world of studying we called sapce repetition. Basically there's a concept called the forgetting **curve**(遗忘曲线) that we discovered by a chap  called Ebbinghaus in like the 1800's.

And the fogetting curve is that whenever we learn anything whether it's like a fat or skill or whatever. We're just gonna forget it. And our memory for the thing is gonna **decay** over time. And so we have to keep on practicing or testing ourselves on the thing to actually continue to our brain kinda use space for that kinda thing, because it likes muscles, when we don't use muscles, our muscles are gonna **atrophy** and we're gonna get less **hench**. Equally our brain, If we learn let's say a language when we were five years old and then we don't use it for the next 10 years, we actually gonna forget most of the language 'cause our brain dosen't need to hava that information in it anymore. 

But thankfully we can combat the forgetting curve by using this concept of spaced repetition, this applies not just to exams, but to any other skill as well. Which is that If we kind repeat the thing at spaced intervals, so that say I might learn a song on the guitar on day one, and then I might repeat it again tomorrow. And then I might test myself on it again next week and then next month, and then six months from now. And if I've spaced my repitition of this thing enough eventually playing that song  is gonna go into my muscle memory(肌肉记忆), it's gonna go into my long-term memory(长时记忆) and I won't need to practice it very much anymore to be able to play it whenever I want.

Now, if you're trying to learn something that has specific facts, there's all sorts of different apps you can use to help with spacing. The one that personally enjoy the most, is free and it's called Anki(确实，背单词的卡片，其他 Youtuber 也推荐过), after the Japanese for Ankishimmers which I think is to memorise. And Anki is just like incredible app that ompletely revolutionised my experience of med school. It does have a bit of a learning curve, and so did you know,<del> I have an entire Skillshare class about how to use Anki, the basics along with some advanced tips along with some guides and how to use Anki to lean absoulty anything along with bonus interviews from other students all around the world that are using Anki for stuff very effectively. If you wanna check that out and any of my other like 10 classes on Skillshare, you should hit the link in the video description because the Skillshare are very currently sponsoring this video. So if you wanna check out my class on Anki, or my class on evidence-based study tips or any my three classes about how to be more productive, then hit the link in the video description. When I was filming this video, Skillshare had an offer of giving you 30% off the annual preminum subscription but it actually changed up that offer. So now, if you're one of the first thousand people to hit the link in the video description you will get one month free trial, completely free to Skillshare premium where you can check out my Anki class and all the other 10 classes I've got on Skillshare. </del>

# Teach what you're learning（费曼学习法）

And finally tip number nine is to teach what you are trying to learn.

We often have this thing of like, oh I'm not allowed to teach something until I become an expert(专家) at it. But there's this concept that C.S.Lewis talks about that I talk about a lot called the curse of knowledge. Which is that, when we're trying to learn something, often we don't learn best from experts, we learn best from people who are just one step in front of us along that same journey.

And so the way I think of it, is that I would rather than learn from a guide, than learn from guru. Guide **versus** **guru**. And I rather be a guide than try and be a guru. And certainly for me, I found that when I was going through medical school, my favorite revision sessions or lectures would be the ones that were given by medical students in the year above me rather than those given by world-class Nobel prize winning professors. Becasue those guys were old and really far removed from the things that I needed at the time, whereas, another medical student just one year above me was really, really helpful. And then when I started teaching medical students, when I started teaching guitar, when I started teaching piano, and Youtube as well with my part-time Youtuber **academy**, I found that anytime I try and teach something, it really **solidifies** my own knowledge and understanding and learning of the thing itself.

And so now I have a general policy whenever I'm learning anything, I'm documenting my process while learning it. And that helps me learn better, 'cause I'm possibaly gonna be teaching this thing a few month or years from now. 

If you like this video, you might like to check out two specific books about learning. One is called, "Make it stick" and the other one is called "Ultralearning". And you can actually find summaries for both of those on shorform which is my favourite way of getting summaries of books. That'll be linked in the video description if you wanna check it out. And if you're interested in this science of efffective learning, check out this video over here, which is from a few years ago, but it still **genuinely** one of my favorite videos of all time that I've ever made. One of the bese ones, I think as well. And that's all about the power of active recall and why testing ourselves is the best thing ever. And I talk about a lot of scientific evidence around it and loads of people have said that that video alone has changed theire lives. So thank you so much for watching hit the subscribe button if you aren't already and I'll see you in the next video, bye-bye.
