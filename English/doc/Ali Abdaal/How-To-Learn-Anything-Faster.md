# Intro

Now, learning has been probally one of my main superpowers, since I was very young. And Learning  how to learn is one of those meta skills. That no one really teaches us. But that can have an enormous impact on our life. In basically that everything we do.

For example, when I was in med（这里应该是 middle） school, I learned how to learn and therefore I could study for everything that I was doing more efficiently and that freed up my own time to do things like set up a business and set up YouTube Channel and these days even though I don't have many more exams to prepare. Learning is still a huge part of my life. Trying to get better at making these Youtube videos, trying to get better at running a business. All of these stuff involves learning.

And so in this video, I'm gonna share 9 tips that I found really helpful that are evidence-based about how we can learn anything we want faster, let's go.

# Sharpen the axe（磨刀不误砍柴工）

Tip number one is sharpen the axe.

This is from a quote that's attributed to Abraham Lincoln（林肯）. Where he famously said that—— If you give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.

And he‘s really talking here about the power of preparation. This definitely applies to learning anything as well. Let's say we are studying for an exam and we wanna learn it a little bit better, reading a great book called "Make It Stick" would be a great way of learning how to learn or <del>checking out my Skillshare class on evidence-based study techniques</del>.

Equally, let's say we're trying to learn something like the guitar or chess or anything like that. Something that's not related to studying. We should still spend a decent amount of time figuring out the meta learning behind what we're actually gonna learn like how we are going to learn the thing.

For example, when I was learning how to play the piano by ear, I spent a decent amount of time on the learn piano subreddit where people explaining how to learn, how to play piano by ear. And just spending a little bit of time sharpening the axe. Before I actually sat down to learn the thing really helped **accelerate** my learning process.

# Use crutches to optimise focus（使用合适的方式优化注意力，例如五分钟法则）

>  As verbs the **difference** between **optimise** and **optimize**
>
> is that **optimise** is (british) (**optimize**) while **optimize** is (originally|intransitive) to act optimistically or as an optimist.

Tip number two is use **crutches** to **optimise** our focus. 

Now, whenever we're learning anything, It's really **tempting** to kind of learn in the backgroud, like practicing the guitar while watching TV or something like that. But obviously, when we're full focused on the thing that we're learning, our brain learns the thing a lot better. And so I found a few different crutches or hacks that have been particularly helpful in helping me focus on things.

One is *the 5 minutes rule* which is general tip for productivity as well. Which is that if we wanna do something and we're finding ourselves have difficulty in starting out doing the thing, like actually getting started, overcoming the **activationg** energy. The five minute rule says that. We just have to **convince** ourselves that we're just gonna do the thing for five minutes. And then after we're done it for five minutes. We're allowed to just not do it, but more often than not, I find that if I've been practicing the guitar, playing the piano for five minutes. I do then want to actually continue to practise. 其实有点像 《Atomic Habits》里面说的，我只做两分钟。

The other thing that's really helpful, just chuck my phone away. I literally take my phone and I **tose** it onto the sofa or on the floor like a good tosser. 

And then I'm really to focus and not be **distracted** with the thing that I'm trying to learn, all right?

扔掉手机，五分钟法则。但是，我不玩手机，没有意思。五分钟法则对我也不是特别有用。

# Find opportunities for immersion（找到任何沉浸下去的机会）

Tip number three is to find opportunities for **immersion**.

名字叫做《超速学习》[中文宣传视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi4wLTxGZc0) 

So there's a great book called "Ultralearning" by a chap called Scott Young. Where he talks about his journey through learning  languages in like three months at a time and becoming fluent in a language in three months. And the key to that as all language learners say is immersion. Just being as immersed in the language as possible.

And the general principle here is that we learn best when we in we're in the environment where we're actually gonna be using the skill. So, for example, when I was learning how to do magic to become a close-up magician, yes I was doing some practices in front of my webcam and in front of my mirror just to get the slight of hand down. But really my webcam or mirror is not the **arena** in which I'm gonna be performing in. And so I made a point to try and perform magic for real people as much as possible. I would take a deck of cards to school and I'd have cards in my room at all times, and so friends would come over, I kind of, hey, be like, hey do you wanna see a magic trick? And eventually onece I got okay at performing for friends and family, I started then reaching out and doing paid **gigs**, even though I was nowhere near good enough in my head to get paid to do magic. Eventually, I did end up getting paid to do magic. And those walk around to gig at balls and parcties helped improve my abilities in a way that just doing it in front of mirror really wouldn't have done.  

勤加练习，时时刻刻准备着。

# Figure out what your weak links are

Tip number 4 is to figure out what are our weak links and the use a lot of drills and stuff to improve them. So if we use med school as an example,  I have few subjects that I was pretty weak in. Neurology was one of them. If you'd asked me what is Guillain-Barré syndrome. I'd have been like, oh God, I have absolutely no idea. 

I didn't have a mental module for where it would fit into the subject of neurology. So when I came to studying efficiently for my exams, I knew that, okay, I have to drill the things that I'm weakest on. And I spend just a whole day, basically creating a one-page **syllabus** of just neurology, just focusing on that one subject. And just because I spent like eight to 12 hours that day they're doing it. I basically plugged it as an area of weakness, and that it was no longer an area of weakness. And the question I would keep on asking myself every day when I was sitting down to stus was, If exam were tomorrow, what topic would I be the least happy, or the most pissed off about?

And then I would just study that topic. And( so many and !!!) this is really good because whenever we're learning or whenever we're studying or anything like that,  it's very tempting to just do the stuff that seems familiar to us. If we're stuying for exam it's very tempting to open up the book to page one      and just even though we already know what's on page one.

If we learning guitar, it's very tempting to just play through songs that we're already played before. But really the learning only happens when we're trying to fix our weaknesses and we're trying to operate at a decent level of difficultly.

If something is too easy, we're not gonna learn anything at all. And so if we wanna maximise the learning and learning anything faster, so we wanna really hone down on what are these areas of weakness, what are therse weak links,  and how do we use drills to improve those as quickly as we can?

找到你的弱处，不断的练习，当然，不能找你认为太容易的，这样没有提升，我也不建议找太难的，找到 a decent level of difficultly.

Figure out your weaknesses, then drills a lot. You shouldn't do easy things for you, you're not gonna learn anything at all. And you shouldn't do a lot higher level things for you, you should operate at a decent level of difficultly.

# Test yourself

Tip number 5 is to test ourselves.

Now, this is a thing that in the world of studying is called active recall, but also applies to the world of learning anything in general. I have a whole video about that.

练习和测试同样重要。

# Get intense Feedback often



# Overlearning



# Spacing



# Teach what you're learning（费曼学习法？）
