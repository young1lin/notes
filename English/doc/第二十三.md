I figure maybe you've already heard of the chain of contempt among overseas Chinese students.

For example, when it comes to country selection, sometimes students who have chosen the US or the UK may have a sense of superiority.

I suppose some of them might look down on others for whatever reason.

The US and the UK are always the most typical and traditional choices.

Probably it's because these countries are well-developed and might have better academic opportunities compared to others.

Besides, it feels like the farther they go, the more independent they are.

And among English-speaking countries, those who study in the US and the UK can pick up a "purer" accent.

Some may be looking to further their careers, some hope to broaden their horizons.

But in my opinion, technically any country could be a cool choice, and you might gain a totally different experience from what you imagined and even some unexpected surprises.
