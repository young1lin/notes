# Will China save the planet or destroy it?

The country's carbon emissions<sup>/iˈmɪʃ.ən/the act of sending out gas, heat, light</sup> will soon peak<sup>the highest, strongest, or best point, value, or level of skill</sup>. Then comes the hard part.

Though he lay dying of brain cancer, Tu Changwang had one last thing to say. The respected Chinese meteorologist<sup>[ˌmiː.ti.əˈrɑ.lə.dʒɪst] 气象学家</sup> had noticed that the climate was warming. So in 1961 he warned in the People's Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece<sup>喉舌A person, newspaper, etc., that speaks on behalf of another person or group of people</sup>, that this might alter the conditions that sustain life. Yet he saw the warming as part of a cycle in solar<sup>[ˈsoʊ.lɚ]Of, relating to, or determined by the sun.</sup> activity that would probably go into reverse at some point. Tu did not suspect that the burning of fossil fuels<sup>[ˈfɑː.səl ˈfjuːəlz]煤炭或天然气等自然燃料</sup> was pumping<sup>排放</sup> carbon dioxide<sup>[ˈkɑːr.bən daɪˈɑk.saɪd] 二氧化碳</sup>into the atmosphere<sup>[ˈatməsˌfir] the envelope of gases surrounding the earth or another planet</sup> and causing the climate the change. In that issue of the People's Daily, a few pages before his paper, there was a photo of **grinning<sup>咧着嘴笑</sup> coal miners**. China was rushing to industrialise with the aim of catching up economically with the West.

But its progress has come at a cost in terms of emissions. Over the past three decades China has released more carbon **dioxide** into the atmosphere, in total, than any other country(see chart 1). It now emits over a quarter of the world's greenhouse gases each year, according to Rhodium Group, an American research firm. That is about twice as much as America, which comes second(though on a per-person basis America is still worse).





Much, then, depends China if the world is to keep global warming since the Industrial Revolution well below 2'C, as governments **pledged**<sup>[plɛdʒd]Committed (oneself) by a solemn promise.</sup> at the UN's annual climate summit in Paris in 2015. This year's summit(called COP28) began on November 30th in Dubai. China has both good and bad news for those attending.

<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/26/yzFpwIhGPHQNkAr.png" alt="image" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"/>On the positive side, China's emissions will soon stop rising. Some analysts think they will top out this year. There is little doubt that the peak will come before 2030, which is the goal China has set for itself. It is building nuclear-power stations faster than any other country. It has also inversted heavily in renewable energy (see chart 2), such that it now has around 750 **gigawatts**<sup>吉瓦</sup> of wind and solar generating capcity, about a third of the world's total. By the end of the decade the government aims to have 1,200 GW of such capcity of the European Union at the moment. China will probably well exceed that target.





But it is not just China's embrace<sup>Accept or support (a belief, theory, or change) willingly and enthusiastically</sup> of renewable energy that is helping it curb<sup>To restrain or keep in check约束/控制</sup> emissions. Its production of carbon-**intensive**<sup>[ˈɪn.tɛn.sɪv]密集的</sup> steel and cement has been dropping. After decades of building roads and railways, the government is **splurging**<sup>[splɝːdʒɪŋ]Spending money freely or extravagantly.</sup> less on big infrastructure projects. A long expansion of the property **sector**<sup>an area or portion that is distinct from others.</sup> has ended in meltdown<sup>[ˈmɛltˌdaʊn]A disastrous collapse or breakdown.</sup> that has shaken the economy - but led to fewer emissions. Going forward, few analysts expect China's GDP to grow as fast as it did at the end of the last century and the beginning of this one. Put another way, China's dirtiest phase of development is probably behind it.

More important than the peak, though, is what happens next. China has pledged to eliminate net emissions of greenhouse gases(or to become "carbon neutral") by [2060](https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/wsdwhfz/202111/t20211111_1303691_ext.html). This will be a much harder target to hit. Even after that massive injection renewables, dirty coal still supplies well over half of China's energy. That is down from around 70% in 2021, but the amount of coal China burns continues to increase, as demand for electricity rises. Last year China mined a record 4.5bn tones of the black rock and approved around two new coal-fired power plants for constuction every week on average.

Many of these may never be built. Declining **utilisation**<sup>[ˌjuː.tɪ.lɪˈzeɪ.ʃən]The action of making practical and effective use of something</sup> rates of existing coal plants undermine the case for further construction<sup>进一步建设</sup>. But China is not moving away from coal as fast as environmentalists would like or analysts say is necessary to meet its 2060 target. Part of the problem is that the country has a lot of it. With little oil or gas, coal provides China a secure source of energy. Digging it up creates jobs. Building a coal plant, whether it is needed or not, is also a common way for local governments to boost economic growth.

China's power grid was built with coal in mind. At plants that burn the stuff, humans decide when to ramp<sup>[ræmp ʌp]To increase the speed, power or cost of something</sup> things up or down. But when it comes to solar and wind power, nature is the boss. So the grid needs to be made more flexible. When there is a surplus of energy in one spot, it must be able to store it or move it elsewhere. Otherwise China will not be able to accommodate lots of new wind **turbines**<sup>[ˈtɜr.baɪnz]Machines for producing continuous power in which a wheel or rotor, typically fitted with vanes, is made to rotate by a fast-moving flow of water, steam, gas, air, or other fluid</sup>and solar panels in the future.
# Gridlock

Most countries need to make similar changes to their grids. The challenge facing China, though, is unique, says David Fishman of the Lantau Group, an energy consultancy. The bulk of the country's solar and wind resources are located in the west. But the power they generate is needed mostly in the east, where the country's biggest cities are to be found. Transferring it over such long distances is tricky. Another problem is that provincial governments have a lot of say over how their portion<sup>[ˈpɔr.ʃən]A part or share of something larger</sup> of the grid operates. They don't like depending on each other for energy. So, for example, a province might prefer to use its own coal plant rather than a cleaner energy source located elsewhere.

Those who are concerned about China's progress also worry about **methane**<sup>[ˈmɛ.θeɪn]甲烷</sup>, a powerful greenhouse gas. Some countries can cut their methane emissions in simple ways, such as by repairing **leaky**<sup>[ˈliː.ki]漏气的</sup> gas pipes. But most of the methane coming from China wafts out of coal mines or is produced by microbes in rice paddies<sup>[raɪs ˈpæd.iz]水稻田</sup>. Fixing the problem is hard without closing mines or changing farming pratices. So at the UN climate summit in 2021, China refused to join more than 100 other countriesm, including America, which pledged to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. Earlier this month, though, China did say that it would address the issue in its national climate plan for 2035(which may not be published for another two years).

In the face of these chanllenges, China's leaders must be bold<sup>大胆的</sup>. But their climate ambitions may have already peaked, says Li Shuo, the incoming director of the China Climate Hub at the Aisa Society Policy Institute in New York. He believes power cuts caused by surging<sup>Moving suddenly and powerfully forward or upward 和 surgery 不属于同一词根，演化不同</sup> coal prices and droughts, which disrupt<sup>interrupt (an event, activity, or process) by causing a disturbance or problem.</sup> hydropower, have spooked<sup>惊吓、幽灵 spooky 幽灵般的</sup> the government in recent years. Now officials worry that climate-friendly polices will undermine the country's energy security(green types argue that some reforms, such as making the grid more flexible, would have the opposite effect). Mr Li expects China's emissions to **plateau** <sup>[plæˈtoʊ]A state of little or no change following a period of activity or progress.趋于平稳</sup>rather than decline.

China, though, has good reason to prioritise the climate. Some of its biggest cities, including Shanghai, lie on the coast and could be swallowed<sup>Engulfed or submerged by something, especially a large amount of water.吞没</sup> by rising seas. The **arid**<sup>Having little or no rain; very dry.</sup> north lacks drinking water. And extreme weather is already taking a toll<sup>The extent of loss, damage, suffering, etc., resulting from some action or disaster. Or a charge payable for permission to use a particular bridge or road. </sup>. Last year deaths associated with heatwaves in China increased by 342% compared with the historical average, according to a study published by the Lancet, a medical journal. This summer floods damaged much of China's wheat crop.

Meanwhile, China has become a leader in green-energy technology. The rest of the world depends largely on Chinese solar-panel and battery supply chains. This year China overtook Japan to become the world's largest car exporter, thanks in part to Chinese **dominance**<sup>Power and influence over others; supremacy.</sup> in electric vehicles.

# Summit and peaks

So there is some hope that China will play a productive role at the climate summit in Dubai. With ambitions to lead the goal south, it will not want to look as if it is **neglecting**<sup>[nɪˈɡlɛktɪŋ]Failing to care for properly; ignoring or disregarding.</sup> an issue that is foremost<sup>Most prominent in rank, importance, or position.</sup> on the mind of many officials in developing countries. Optimists also point to the meeting between Xie Zhenhua, China's climate envoy, and John Kerry, his American counterpart, in November. They agreed on some small steps, such as collarborating on carbon-capture projects.

Yet China has also made clear that it will not how to pressure on climate change. Earlier this year Xi Jinping, its leader, **reiterated**<sup>[riˈɪt.ər.eɪ.tɪd]Said again, typically for emphasis or clarity.</sup> his aim of reaching a carbon peak 2030 and achieving carbon **neutrality**<sup>A state of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions.</sup> by 2060. But the path, method, pace and intensity to achieve this goal should and must be determined by ourselves, and will never be influenced by others, he said.
