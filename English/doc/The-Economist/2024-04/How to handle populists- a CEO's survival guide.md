This year Western bosses must work their way through a lengthy list of **obsequious** phone calls. Around 80 countries, home to some 4bn people, are holding elections in 2024(not always freely, as in Russia in March). Some chief executives may already have drafted their compliments for Narendra Modi, who is almost certain to keep his job as prime minister of India, where citizens are now casting ballots in a weeks-long-festival of democracy. After Mexico's election in June most corporate leaders expect to be congratulating presidnet-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, the **anointed** successor of the incumbent, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Western firms working to reduce their **reliance on** China have turned to India and Mexico. But neither prospect fills them with **unadulterated delight**<sup>纯粹的喜悦</sup>. Mr Modi may have made his counry an easier place to do business, by simplifying its tax system and investing in infrastructure, among other things. But he has also raised tariffs on goods like cards and increased the tax advantage that domestic firms enjoy over foreign ones. Mr Lopez Obrador has been nationalising hte assets of Western firms in industries from construction meterial to energy and has allowed Mexico's criminal gangs to run rampant. Indonesia, another market that has caught the eye of Western businesses, elected a populist of its own, Prabowo Subianto, in February.

CEOs are fiding little comfort in elections closer to home. Few are thrilled at the prospect of Donald Trump, a self-described "Tariff Man"<sup>关税侠</sup>, **triumphing** in November, even with his talk of slashing red tape. They also feel **ambivalent** about Joe Biden, the incumbent who talks of raising corporate taxes and blames greedy businesses for stubborn inflation. In Britain, the ruling Conservatives have **scorned** the pleas of companies to keep trade with the EU flowing. Yet many corporate grandees remain sceptical that Labour will champion their interests if, as expected, the left-of-centre party **sails** into government later this year. Nationalist parties dubious of free trade are predicted to expand their foothhold in the European Parlianment after elections in June. One such party is on track to win Austria's national poll later this year.

The long-term trend is clear. *The Economist*, using data from the Manifesto Project, a research group, has looked at the ratio of favourable to unfavourable discussions of free enterprise in the manifestors of political parties in 35 Western countries from 1975 to 2021, the most recent year available(see chart 1). We used a five-year-moving average and excluded political parties that won less than 5% of the vote. In the 1990s **deregulation**, privatisation, **unfettered** trade and other policies that bring joy to the hearts of businessmen were praised almost twice as often as they were **criticised**. Now politicians are more likely to trash these ideas than celebrate them.
