# 动词的分类

- 实义动词（notional verb）
- 助动词（auxiliary verb）
- 情态动词 （modal verb）

# 实义动词（notional verb）

- 具备完整的词汇意义。
- 能单独充当句子的谓语。

除了助动词和情态动词以外，其余都是实义动词。

再复习一下之前的句子格式，**主谓宾定状补**。

# 助动词（auxiliary verb）

- 不具备词汇意义
- 不能单独充当句子的谓语，必须和实义动词连用。以帮助构成各种**时态、语态、语气、否定和疑问**等。

## be, do, have

助动词有三，be, do, have

不同的形式

- be
  - am
  - is 
  - are
  - was
  - were
  - been
  - being
- do
  - does
  - did
- have
  - has
  - had
  - having

这三个词也可以用作实义动词。

am 是

have you

do 做

# 情态动词（modal verb）

- 有别于助动词，有其自身的词汇意义。
  - 情态动词有其自身的词汇意义，如用来**表示可能、建议、愿望、必要、允许、能力、怀疑**等等，以表示说话者对某种行为或状态的看法或态度。

有下面 10 个

- can/could
- may/might
- Shall/should
- Will/would
- must/had better

还有些类似的短语

- be able to 
- be going to 
- ought to, be supposed to 
- have to, have got to 

need 和 dare 既可是实义动词，也可是情态动词。

短文判断动词。

>Two men were（情态动词） standing（实义动词） at a bar. One man turned（实义动词） to the other and said（实义动词）, "I'll bet（实义动词） you $100 that I can（情态动词） bite（实义动词） my left eye." The wager was（情态动词，表被动） accepted（实义动词）, and the man popped（实义动词） out his glass eye and bit（实义动词） it.
>
>"Now," he said, "I'll（情态动词） give（实义动词） you a chance to win（实义动词） your money back. I'll（情态动词） bet（实义动词） you another $100 that I can bite（实义动词） my right eye." "He can't（情态动词） have two glass eyes, " thought the other man, and he plunked down his money.
>
>The first man took out his false teeth and bit his right eye.

这个我看过。

# 陈述句的否定

- 含 Be 动词或者情态动词

直接在后面加 not

- 是实义动词的否定

do not, does not , did not

注意后面都是加动词原形。

- 否定的缩写
  - Am not/ 没有缩写
  - are not/ aren't
  - is not/isn't
  - Was not/wasn't
  - Were not/weren't
  - do not/don't
  - does not/doesn't
  - did not/didn't
  - have not/haven't
  - has not/hasn't
  - had not/hadn't
  - **Will not/won't**
  - Would not/wouldn't
  - **shall not/shan't**
  - should not/shouldn't
  - Cannot/can't
  - Could not/couldn't
  - may not/没有
  - Might not/mightn't
  - must not/mustn't

就两个特殊，其他都一样。

# 一般疑问句

- 含有 Be 动词/情态动词的
- 谓语是实义动词的。

# 特殊疑问句

- 不与名词连用的疑问句
  - who
  - what
  - when
  - where
  - how
    - 对动作的方式进行提问
      - how do you to work?
    - 与形容词或副词连用
      - how old are you?
    - frequency
      - how often/how many time..?
  - why
