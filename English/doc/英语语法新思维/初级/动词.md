# 动词的分类

- 实义动词（notional verb）
- 助动词（auxiliary verb）
- 情态动词 （modal verb）

# 实义动词（notional verb）

- 具备完整的词汇意义。
- 能单独充当句子的谓语。

除了助动词和情态动词以外，其余都是实义动词。

再复习一下之前的句子格式，**主谓宾定状补**。

# 助动词（auxiliary verb）

- 不具备词汇意义
- 不能单独充当句子的谓语，必须和实义动词连用。以帮助构成各种**时态、语态、语气、否定和疑问**等。

## be, do, have

助动词有三，be, do, have

不同的形式

- be
  - am
  - is 
  - are
  - was
  - were
  - been
  - being
- do
  - does
  - did
- have
  - has
  - had
  - having

这三个词也可以用作实义动词。

am 是

have you

do 做

# 情态动词（modal verb）

- 有别于助动词，有其自身的词汇意义。
  - 情态动词有其自身的词汇意义，如用来**表示可能、建议、愿望、必要、允许、能力、怀疑**等等，以表示说话者对某种行为或状态的看法或态度。

有下面 10 个

- can/could
- may/might
- Shall/should
- Will/would
- must/had better

还有些类似的短语

- be able to 
- be going to 
- ought to, be supposed to 
- have to, have got to 

need 和 dare 既可是实义动词，也可是情态动词。

短文判断动词。

>Two men were（情态动词） standing（实义动词） at a bar. One man turned（实义动词） to the other and said（实义动词）, "I'll bet（实义动词） you $100 that I can（情态动词） bite（实义动词） my left eye." The wager was（情态动词，表被动） accepted（实义动词）, and the man popped（实义动词） out his glass eye and bit（实义动词） it.
>
>"Now," he said, "I'll（情态动词） give（实义动词） you a chance to win（实义动词） your money back. I'll（情态动词） bet（实义动词） you another $100 that I can bite（实义动词） my right eye." "He can't（情态动词） have two glass eyes, " thought the other man, and he plunked down his money.
>
>The first man took out his false teeth and bit his right eye.

这个我看过。

# 陈述句的否定

- 含 Be 动词或者情态动词

直接在后面加 not

- 是实义动词的否定

do not, does not , did not

注意后面都是加动词原形。

- 否定的缩写
  - Am not/ 没有缩写
  - are not/ aren't
  - is not/isn't
  - Was not/wasn't
  - Were not/weren't
  - do not/don't
  - does not/doesn't
  - did not/didn't
  - have not/haven't
  - has not/hasn't
  - had not/hadn't
  - **Will not/won't**
  - Would not/wouldn't
  - **shall not/shan't**
  - should not/shouldn't
  - Cannot/can't
  - Could not/couldn't
  - may not/没有
  - Might not/mightn't
  - must not/mustn't

就两个特殊，其他都一样。

# 一般疑问句

- 含有 Be 动词/情态动词的
- 谓语是实义动词的。

# 特殊疑问句

- 不与名词连用的疑问句
  - who
  - what
  - when
  - where
  - how
    - 对动作的方式进行提问
      - how do you to work?
    - 与形容词或副词连用
      - how old are you?
    - frequency
      - how often/how many time..?
  - why
- 要与名词连用的疑问句
  - which
  - whose



Exercise 5.4-5.6 

改成否定，然后一般疑问句，并作出肯定及否定回答，再提出一个特殊疑问句。

# 主语+系动词+表语

系动词又叫联系（linking verb）动词，不表示具体的动作，只是起连接主语和后面成分的作用。这种动词后面所接的成分是用来说明主语的特点，表明主语的性质特征的，因此我们称之为主语补足语，或表语（能表示主语特征的成分）。

He looks 不能表达完整意思，looks 来连接 He 和 happy，所以 happy 是表语，looks 是系动词。

- He *looks*（系动词） happy（表语）.
- I *am* a Webaholic.
- Chatting on the Internet *is* interesting.
- Learning English *is* important.
- He *became* a teacher.
- The leaf will *turn* yellow in autumn.

最常见的系动词是 be 动词，其他的系动词还有

- look
- sound
- smell
- taste
- feel
- seem
- appear
- become
- turn

# 主语 + 谓语

该句型的谓语动词是不及物动词（intransitive verb），所表示的动作没有作用对象，其本身的意思完整，其后不需带宾语。

**及物动词和不及物动词**

在英语中看**动词**后面可否直接跟宾语，可以把**动词**分成两种：**及物动词**与**不及物动词**。 字典里词后标有vt. 的就是**及物动词**；字典里词后标有vi. 的就是**不及物动词**。 **及物动词**可直接跟宾语。 **不及物动词**后不能直接跟有动作的对象（即宾语），若要跟宾语，必须先在其后添加上某个介词，如to,of ,at，如此方可跟上宾语。

- He died.
- These children are playing.
- Internet dating hurt.
- The fire is burning
- Children giggle.（咯咯地笑）
- The sun rises and sun sets. Stars glitter and stars vanish.



- The sun sets the west.
- He works hard.

这种句型中的谓语动词的后面虽然不接宾语，但通常会接副词（如hard）或介词短语（如in thewest）来说明动作的方式、地点或时间等等。英文中把**这种修饰动作的成分称作状语**。

- They shouted *loudly*. 方式状语
- He died *at home*. 地点状语
- He died in *2007*. 时间状语

**主谓状和主系表的区别**。

- He shouted loudly.
- He looks happy.

shouted是不及物动词，副词loudly修饰动作shouted，作状语。在例句2）中，looks是系动词，没有具体的动作。形容词happy不是修饰looks的，而是补充说明主语he的特征，作表语。

# 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语

该句型的谓语动词是**及物动词**（transitiveverb），这种动词告诉我们由主语发出的动作所作用的对象是什么，**这里所作用的对象就是我们通常称之为宾语**的，即宾语是主语动作的**承受对象**，因此这类动词是带有宾语的。

- These children are playing football.
- These children are playing.

这个 play 可做及物和不及物，类似的还有其他的词。当然，意思和用法都不一样。

- I（主） like（谓语） chatting（宾语） on the internet（状语）.
- He speaks English well （修饰 speaks，作状语）.

# 主语 + 谓语 + 间接宾语 + 直接宾语

该句型的谓语动词是双宾动词（dative verb），这种动词的后面所接成分有“人”又有“物”。一般来讲，这里的“人”**表示动作的接受者**，称作间接宾语（indirect object）。“物”表示动作作用的对象，是**动作的承受者**，称作直接宾语（directobject）。间接宾语和直接宾语合起来叫做双宾语。

- Chatting online will *bring* you a lot of fun.
- He *lent* me ten yuan.
- I will *buy* you a meal.
- I *gave* him my book.
- He *showed* the guard his passport.

# 主语 + 谓语  + 宾语 + 宾语补足语

该句型中的谓语动词是宾补动词（factitiveverb），这种动词的后面接宾语，而此宾语的后面又接补充说明宾语的补足语（objectcomplement）。

- We can *call* Internet addicts a Webaholic.
- We *elected* John chairman.
- I *found* this answer wrong.
- You can *leave* the door open.
- A hedge between *keeps* friendship green. 君子之交淡如水

我们若只说You can leave the door.就表示“你可以把门”，这句话的意思显然不完整，于是我们要对宾语the door进一步补充说明一下，说成You can leave the door open.这样句子的意思才完整。

Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic - [Leave the door open!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adLGHcj_fmA) 

我是想不到的。

# 再次复习

He looks 不能表达完整意思，looks 来连接 He 和 happy，所以 happy 是表语，looks 是系动词。

最常见的系动词是 be 动词，其他的系动词还有

- look
- sound
- smell
- taste
- feel
- seem
- appear
- become
- turn

该句型的谓语动词是不及物动词（intransitive verb），所表示的动作没有作用对象，其本身的意思完整，其后不需带宾语。

该句型的谓语动词是**及物动词**（transitive verb），这种动词告诉我们由主语发出的动作所作用的对象是什么，**这里所作用的对象就是我们通常称之为宾语**的，即宾语是主语动作的**承受对象**，因此这类动词是带有宾语的。

该句型的谓语动词是双宾动词（dative verb），这种动词的后面所接成分有“人”又有“物”。一般来讲，这里的“人”**表示动作的接受者**，称作间接宾语（indirect object）。“物”表示动作作用的对象，是**动作的承受者**，称作直接宾语（directobject）。间接宾语和直接宾语合起来叫做双宾语。

该句型中的谓语动词是宾补动词（factitive verb），这种动词的后面接宾语，而此宾语的后面又接补充说明宾语的补足语（objectcomplement）。

1. Time 主语 files by 谓语.  + ，时光飞逝
2. It slipped my mind. 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语，它让我忘记了。
3. I can't stand the heat. 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语。  我忍受不了热。
4. Fool seldom differ. 主语 + 谓语。傻瓜都一样。
5. I sent you an E-mail. 主语 + 谓语 + 间接宾语 + 直接宾语。我给你发了封电子邮件。人表示动作的接受者。
6. It cost me three dollars. 主语 + 谓语 + 间接宾语 + 直接宾语，人表示动作的接受者。
7. Old habits die hard. 主语+谓语 旧习难改
8. You can leave the door open 宾语补足语. 主语 + 谓语  + 宾语 + 宾语补足语
9. He speaks English well. 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语
10. Teachers will make your English better. 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 宾语补足语，better 是状态补足语。
11. They elected George W. Bush US President.  主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 宾语补足语，better 是身份？补足语。
12. The novel won the author a Nobel Prize.
13. That will save you a lot of time.
14. They found the dead boy.
15. The found the boy dead.

翻译，分析每个句子的类型。

24. A sentence normally has a subject and predicate. The subject identifies a person, place or thing. The predicate tells what the subject does or is.

    The predicate always includes a verb, and a verb is one of three types-linking, intransitive(不及物), or transitive（及物） verbs.

    The most widely used linking verb is a form of be, such as am, is, are, was, or were. Other linking verbs include: seem, become, feel, sound, taste, smell. The word or phrase that follows a linking verb is called a subjet complement.

分析下文中划线句子的成分。

25. Two men were standing at a bar．One man turned to the other and said,“I'll bet you \$100 that I can bite my lefteye.” The wager was accepted, andthe man popped out his glass eyeand bit it.“Now, ” he said, “I'll give you a chance to winyour money back. I'll bet you another ​\$100 thatI can bite my right eye.” “He can't have twoglass eyes, ” thought the other man, and he plunked down his money.Then the first man took out his false teeth andbit his right eye.

26. Losers look for quick fixes.

    There are two ways of getting rid of weeds inyour yard: the easy way and the not-so-easyway. The easy way may be to run a lawnmowerand the yard looks fine for a while, but that isa temporary answer. Soon the weeds are back.But the not-so-easy way may mean gettingdown on your hands and knees and pulling outthe weeds by the roots. It is time-consumingand painful, but the weeds will stay away for alonger time. The first solution appeared easy,but the problem remained. The second solutionwas not so easy, but took care of the problemfrom the roots. The key is to get to the root ofthe problem.The same thing is true of our attitude in life.The problem with people today is that theywant instant answer. They are looking for one-minute solutions to everything. Just like instantcoffee, they want instant happiness. There areno quick fixes. This attitude leads todisappointment or even failure.
