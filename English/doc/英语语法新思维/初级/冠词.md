# 冠词的位置与读音

冠词有三，其二为 a 、an 和 the。但若从语音的角度来说，英语中的冠词应该有四个：除了两个不定冠词a和an外，定冠词 the 也有两个。一个是用在辅音前（before the consonant）的 the，读成[ðə]；一个是用在元音前（before the vowel）的the，读成[ði]。此外，大家都知道，不定冠词a用在以辅音音素（并非辅音字母）开头的名词前；不定冠词an用在以元音音素（并非元音字母）开头的名词前。所以，从上述读音的角度来看，定冠词 the 如同不定冠词 a（n）一样，在元音和辅音之前的读音是有区别的，尽管拼写上都是the。

元音读音开头用 an。

- a university, a unique person
- an unkind old lady
- an hour ------ 读成元音
- an honor-----
- an SOS sign
- An L letter is in the word "letter"
- A C letter is in the word "count".
- the MP ------ M 读成[em]，以元音 [e] 开头，所以这里读成 [ði] 此外，值得注意的是，有时在口语中表示“迟疑一下”的时候，或者想强调下面一个词时，即便这个词以辅音开头，前面的the也读成[ði]。比如在著名的人名前面加the，此时就是为了强调的，所以the的读音为[ði]。
- A: My name is James Bond. B: What, not *the* James Bond?



1. Telling lies is a fault in a boy, an art in a lover, an accomplishment in a bachelor, and second-nature in a married man.

# 冠词用法概述

## 冠词用法与名词结合讨论

正确划分英语名词的可数与不可数对掌握冠词的用法至关重要。**将普通名词划分为可数名词和不可数名词是正确运用冠词的前提**。

对于冠词的用法，读者要关注这样三类名词：不可数名词、单数名词和复数名词。

## 区分特指（specific reference ）与泛指（generic reference）

1. The lion is a dangerous animal.
2. The lion espcaped from zoo.



1. The tiger is becoming almost extinct.
2. The tiger is sleeping in the cage.

冠词的特指用法会设计说话者/作者（speaker/writer） 与听话者/读者（listener/reader）之间的共有知识。

对于the来说，就是特指和泛指。定冠词主要是表示特指的用法，其次才是表示泛指的用法。但对于不定冠词a/an来说，不能表示特指，主要是用来表示泛指。此外，对于不定冠词，其实还有一个定指/不定指的概念（specific or nonspecificreference）。

## 结合上下文语境

### 与其他问题结合

a number of people are.../the number of people is...

# 四种泛指的表达模式

一般来说，这三类名词与英语的冠词有四种不同的搭配使用规则，从而衍生出四种不同的模式来表示泛指意义。具体来说就是：

1. 不可数名词不加冠词表示泛指；
2. 复数名词不加冠词表示泛指；
3. 单数名词与定冠词the连用可以表示泛指；
4. 单数名词与不定冠词a/an连用可以表示泛指。

## 不可数名词不加冠词表示泛指

1. Life  is hard sometimes. -- 泛指
2. Life is education in itself. -- 泛指
3. The writer is writing a book about the life of blacks in America.-- 特指
4. I am studing the life of Beethoven.-- 特指



1. I love music, poetry and art.
2. I don't like the film, but I like the music (of the film). -- 特指这部电影的音乐。



1. Air is a colorless and tasteless gas. -- 泛指
2. The air in this room is stuffy. Please open the windows. -- 特指



1. Sugar isn't very good for you. --泛指
2. Can you pass me the sugar, please? -- 特指

**泛指**

1. Hydrogen is lighter than oxygen.
2. Water is essential for life.
3. Life without music would be nothing.
4. Necessity is the mother of invention.
5. Happiness is often the product of honesty and hard work.
6. Theory must go hand in hand with practice.

## 复数名词不加冠词表示泛指

复数名词同不可数名词一样，在表示泛指时，不可与定冠词the连用。如果与the连用，此时复数名词是表示特指。

1. Books become more and more expensive.
2. Books fill leisure time for many people.
3. Put away the books on your desk.
4. Move the books off that chair and sit down.

一般来说，“the+复数名词”不能用作泛指，而只能表示特指。不过，有两种特殊的表示复数名词概念的结构，是与the连用的，却可以表示泛指：一是“the+国籍名词”，二是“the+形容词”。

1. The Chinese are a great people.
2. The industrious Chinese are admired bytheir neighbors.

在英文中，“the+形容词”表示一类人，是泛指，**相当于在形容词的后面省去了people**，所以被看作是复数名词，作主语时，谓语要用复数。

1. The poor are causing the nation's leadersgreat concern.
2. The wise avoid such temptations.
3. The emotionally disturbed and thephysically and mentally handicapped need theaid of society.

## 单数名词与定冠词the连用可以表示泛指

1. The tiger is becoming almost extinct.
2. Tigers are becomming almost extinct.



1. The whale is the largest mammal on earth.
2. The whale is dead.



1. The elephant is the largest land mammal.
2. The elephant over there has only one tusk.

3. Water consists of hydropgen and oxygen.
4. I don't want to go swimming today. The water is too cold.
5. Health is more important than money.

7. Gold is a precious metal.
8. The gold in Mary's ring is 24 karats.
9. Vegetables are good for you.
10. The vegetables we had for dinner last night were overcooked.

## 单数名词与不定冠词a/an连用可以表示泛指

“a/an+单数可数名词”可以表示泛指，不定冠词a/an的泛指用法指的是某一类事物中任何一个具有代表性的成员，所以我们可以用any来替换a/an。

1. A tiger is a dangerous animal.
2. The tiger is  dangerous animal.
3. Tigers are dangerous animals.



1. A teacher should be patient with his or her students.
2. A growing child needs great nourishment.
3. A child needs plenty of love.
4. The best way to learn a language is to live among its speakers.
5. A dog makes a good pet.
6. A tiger is a dangerous animal.
7. Any tiger is a dangerous animal.

a/an与单数名词连用表示泛指，这主要是限于用在主语的位置，如果是处在其他位置则不表示泛指。甚至即使是在主语位置，也不一定都是表示泛指的概念。

# 定冠词 the 的特指用法

我们说定冠词the表特指，就是指根据说话者和听话者共有的知识，或根据上下文，可以识别的独特的某物。

1. I went to New York City last week. Thetraffic is awful.
2. Have you fed the cat?

## 情景/文化特指（situational/cultural reference）

定冠词the用于这一类特指，必须依赖于说话者和听话者双方共有的知识

1. Albert Einstein, the famous physicist.
2. Here is an article about Joan Chen, a famous Chinese actress. She is famous both in China, where she grew up, and in the United States,where she now lives. How did Joan become afamous actress in two countries? It's an interesting story.

S.“Who?” he asked.“David Beckham, the famous British soccer player.” I replied patiently, excusing my dad's apparent loss of hearing. He is getting old,after all.“Who's he?” Dad asked, hearing loud andclear.
