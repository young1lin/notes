# 冠词的位置与读音

冠词有三，其二为 a 、an 和 the。但若从语音的角度来说，英语中的冠词应该有四个：除了两个不定冠词a和an外，定冠词 the 也有两个。一个是用在辅音前（before the consonant）的 the，读成[ðə]；一个是用在元音前（before the vowel）的the，读成[ði]。此外，大家都知道，不定冠词a用在以辅音音素（并非辅音字母）开头的名词前；不定冠词an用在以元音音素（并非元音字母）开头的名词前。所以，从上述读音的角度来看，定冠词 the 如同不定冠词 a（n）一样，在元音和辅音之前的读音是有区别的，尽管拼写上都是the。

元音读音开头用 an。

- a university, a unique person
- an unkind old lady
- an hour ------ 读成元音
- an honor-----
- an SOS sign
- An L letter is in the word "letter"
- A C letter is in the word "count".
- the MP ------ M 读成[em]，以元音 [e] 开头，所以这里读成 [ði] 此外，值得注意的是，**有时在口语中表示“迟疑一下”的时候，或者想强调下面一个词时**，即便这个词以辅音开头，前面的the也读成[ði]。比如在著名的人名前面加the，此时就是为了强调的，所以the的读音为[ði]。
- A: My name is James Bond. B: What, not *the* James Bond?



1. Telling lies is a fault in a boy, an art in a lover, an accomplishment in a bachelor, and second-nature in a married man.

# 冠词用法概述

## 冠词用法与名词结合讨论

正确划分英语名词的可数与不可数对掌握冠词的用法至关重要。**将普通名词划分为可数名词和不可数名词是正确运用冠词的前提**。

对于冠词的用法，读者要关注这样三类名词：不可数名词、单数名词和复数名词。

## 区分特指（specific reference ）与泛指（generic reference）

1. The lion is a dangerous animal.
2. The lion espcaped from zoo.



1. The tiger is becoming almost extinct.
2. The tiger is sleeping in the cage.

冠词的特指用法会设计说话者/作者（speaker/writer） 与听话者/读者（listener/reader）之间的共有知识。

对于the来说，就是特指和泛指。定冠词主要是表示特指的用法，其次才是表示泛指的用法。但对于不定冠词a/an来说，不能表示特指，主要是用来表示泛指。此外，对于不定冠词，其实还有一个定指/不定指的概念（specific or nonspecificreference）。

## 结合上下文语境

### 与其他问题结合

a number of people are.../the number of people is...

# 四种泛指的表达模式

一般来说，这三类名词与英语的冠词有四种不同的搭配使用规则，从而衍生出四种不同的模式来表示泛指意义。具体来说就是：

1. **不可数名词不加冠词表示泛指**；
2. **复数名词不加冠词表示泛指**；
3. **单数名词与定冠词the连用可以表示泛指**；
4. **单数名词与不定冠词a/an连用可以表示泛指**。

## 不可数名词不加冠词表示泛指

1. Life  is hard sometimes. -- 泛指
2. Life is education in itself. -- 泛指
3. The writer is writing a book about the life of blacks in America.-- 特指
4. I am studying the life of Beethoven.-- 特指



1. I love music, poetry and art.
2. I don't like the film, but I like the music (of the film). -- 特指这部电影的音乐。



1. Air is a colorless and tasteless gas. -- 泛指
2. The air in this room is stuffy. Please open the windows. -- 特指



1. Sugar isn't very good for you. --泛指
2. Can you pass me the sugar, please? -- 特指

**泛指**

1. Hydrogen is lighter than oxygen.
2. Water is essential for life.
3. Life without music would be nothing.
4. Necessity is the mother of invention.
5. Happiness is often the product of honesty and hard work.
6. Theory must go hand in hand with practice.

## 复数名词不加冠词表示泛指

复数名词同不可数名词一样，在表示泛指时，不可与定冠词the连用。如果与the连用，此时复数名词是表示特指。

1. Books become more and more expensive.
2. Books fill leisure time for many people.
3. Put away the books on your desk.
4. Move the books off that chair and sit down.

一般来说，“the+复数名词”不能用作泛指，而只能表示特指。不过，有两种特殊的表示复数名词概念的结构，是与the连用的，却可以表示泛指：一是“the+国籍名词”，二是“the+形容词”。

1. The Chinese are a great people.
2. The industrious Chinese are admired bytheir neighbors.

在英文中，“the+形容词”表示一类人，是泛指，**相当于在形容词的后面省去了people**，所以被看作是复数名词，作主语时，谓语要用复数。

1. The poor are causing the nation's leadersgreat concern.
2. The wise avoid such temptations.
3. The emotionally disturbed and thephysically and mentally handicapped need theaid of society.

## 单数名词与定冠词the连用可以表示泛指

1. The tiger is becoming almost extinct.
2. Tigers are becomming almost extinct.



1. The whale is the largest mammal on earth.
2. The whale is dead.



1. The elephant is the largest land mammal.
2. The elephant over there has only one tusk.

练习

1. The flowers in that vase are beautiful.
2. Flowers are beautiful.
3. Water consists of hydropgen and oxygen.
4. I don't want to go swimming today. The water is too cold.
5. Health is more important than money.
6. Doctors are concerned with the health of their patients.
7. Gold is a precious metal.
8. The gold in Mary's ring is 24 karats.
9. Vegetables are good for you.
10. The vegetables we had for dinner last night were overcooked.

## 单数名词与不定冠词a/an连用可以表示泛指

“a/an+单数可数名词”可以表示泛指，不定冠词a/an的泛指用法指的是某一类事物中任何一个具有代表性的成员，所以我们可以用any来替换a/an。

1. A tiger is a dangerous animal.
2. The tiger is  dangerous animal.
3. Tigers are dangerous animals.



1. A teacher should be patient with his or her students.
2. A growing child needs great nourishment.
3. A child needs plenty of love.
4. The best way to learn a language is to live among its speakers.
5. A dog makes a good pet.
6. A tiger is a dangerous animal.
7. Any tiger is a dangerous animal.

a/an与单数名词连用表示泛指，这主要是限于用在主语的位置，如果是处在其他位置则不表示泛指。甚至即使是在主语位置，也不一定都是表示泛指的概念。

Exercise

1. The flowers in that vase are beautiful.
2. Flowers are beautiful.
3. Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
4. I don't want to go swimming today. The water is too cold.
5. Health is more important than money.

7. Gold is precious metal.
8. The gold in Mary's ring is 24 karats.
9. Vegetables are good for you.
10. The vegetables we had for dinner lastnight werecooked.

# 定冠词 the 的特指用法

我们说定冠词the表特指，就是指根据说话者和听话者共有的知识，或根据上下文，可以识别的独特的某物。

1. I went to New York City last week. Thetraffic is awful.
2. Have you fed the cat?

## 情景/文化特指（situational/cultural reference）

定冠词the用于这一类特指，必须依赖于说话者和听话者双方共有的知识

1. Albert Einstein, the famous physicist.
2. Here is an article about Joan Chen, a famous Chinese actress. She is famous both in China, where she grew up, and in the United States,where she now lives. How did Joan become afamous actress in two countries? It's an interesting story.
3. David Who? Never Heard of That GuyIt looks like the most famous soccer player on the face of the earth will have his work cut outfor him when he arrives in the U. S. And I'm not talking about the competition he'll face on thepitch.On Saturday, I asked my dad if he'd heard that David Beckham was coming to play in the U. S.“Who?” he asked.“David Beckham, the famous British soccer player.” I replied patiently, excusing my dad's apparent loss of hearing. He is getting old,after all.“Who's he?” Dad asked, hearing loud andclear.

### 一般常识（General knowledge）/较大情景

这里的“一般常识”指的就是说话者与听话者共同具有的较大情景的知识。由于这样的一般常识，因而定冠词the所指的对象究竟是什么，这对双方来说都是不言而喻的。比如说到太阳（sun），我们要用the来定指，因为说话者与听话者双方都知道这个所指物，这是不言而喻的。传统的语法书上说的“表示独一无二的事物要用the”就属于这个用法。所指物对于所有人来说都知道，都是独一无二的。

1. The North Pole
2. The Equator
3. The earth
4. The moon
5. The sky

### 具体知识（Specific knowlege）/局部情景（local use）

说话者与听话者共有的知识只是局限在一个特定的较小的范围内，比如对于同一个家庭或村庄的成员来说是独一无二的。
比如在一个小镇上生活的人们，彼此之间谈到thepost office, the market, the church或the castle时，指的就是该镇上唯一的这些场所，或者是他们常去的这些场所。

1. Have you visited the castle?
2. I missied both the lectures this morning.
3. Let's go to the library.

### 即时情景用法（immediate situation）

在说话的时刻，所指为双方唯一看到或听到的。此时，定冠词the的所指是从语言以外的实境（theextra-linguistic situation）中推知的。

1. The roses are very beautiful.
2. These are the pistons.
3. Can you find the page?

## 上下文共指（textual coreference）

上下文共指，就是指听话者或读者可以根据上下文找到所指。

- 前指（anaphoricreference）
  - 直接前指（direct anaphora）
  - 间接前指（indirect anaphora）
- 后指（cataphoric reference）

### 直接前指

前面话语中已经提供的信息使后文中的某个名词短语特指某个事物，这即是前指。直接前指是指前面提到的某个事物，在后文中再次提到，这样前后两个名词短语是一种共指关系（co-reference），指代同一个事物。由于第一次提到的物体通常是不定指的，所以常用不定冠词a/an来限定。可是一旦那个物体在话语中已经谈到过，就可以把它看作“从上文中已得知的东西”，此后再提到它时就要用定冠词。这就是传统语法书上所说的，“第一次提到的单数可数名词前面用不定冠词a或an，这一名词再次出现时则要用定冠词the”。

1. I had a banana and an apple. I ate thebanana and gave the apple to Clint.
2. Once upon a time, there was a littel girl. The girl lived with her mother and father.
3. A man came up to a policeman and asked him a question.
4. I did a grammar course last year. My friend is going to the course next year.
5. Bob lost a gold watch yesterday, and Bill was wearing a gold watch this morning.

### 间接前指/话题与定冠词 the

间接前指，表示所指的对象间接地成为听话者知识的一部分。这种知识不是通过上面讨论的那样的直接谈及而获得，而是从已经谈到的事物中推断得到的。此时，在上文中往往会提到的一个与下文有紧密联系的概念或谈论的话题，然后下文围绕这个话题展开讨论。

1. John bought a bicycle, but when he rode itone of the wheels came off.
2. I read a great novel last week. The imagery was fantastic.
3. I went to New York last week. The traffic is awful.
4. They got married in grand style. The bridewore a long brocade dress, and the bride-maids wore pink taffeta. The organist playedsuperb music, and the choir sangmagnificently.

### 后指/结构特指

后指，也叫结构特指（structural reference），往往出现在带有后置定语的名词短语中。一般来说，被某个后置定语所修饰的名词的前面要用定冠词the。

1. The brick house on the corner is mine.
2. The role of women in today's society has been achieved through centuries of major cultural changes.
3. The state of women's health in the 1990s reflects the price of progress.
4. In this special health report we look into the causes and cures of your six most common health complaints.

4. A: Do you need the car today, honey?
   B: Yes. I have a lot of  things to do. Why don't I drive you to work today?

   A: Ok. But be sure to fill the car up with gas.

5. Yesterday I saw a dog and a cat. The dog was chasing the cat. The cat was chasing a mouse. The mouse ran into a hole, but the hole was very small. The cat couldn't get into the hole, so it ran up a tree. The dog tried to climb the tree too, but it couldn't.

6. Yesterday I saw a man and a woman. They were having a argument. The man was yelling at the woman, and the woman ws shouting at the man. I don't know what the argument was about.


the 与句中哪个词具有指代关系，在该词下面划线。
7. He owned a <u>huge estate</u>. **The** land and **the** building were worth millions.

12. It was a most <u>dreadful accident</u>; **the survivors** had to spend the night on a cold mountainside.

13. I think ordinary people in Vietnam must have suffered terribly during **the** years of their war with America. 特指越战那些年。
14. I feel very sorry for people who have to live in cicties which they absolutely hate because the have no choice.

名人名言

18. "All good books are alike in that are truer than if they had really happened." - Earnest Hemingway, 20 century American novelist. 一般来说，“the+复数名词”不能用作泛指，而只能表示特指。这里是泛指，所以不能用 the.
19. "A worker is the slave of the capitalist society; a female worker is the slave of the slave."- James Connolly, Irish 19th century political thinker. a/an+单数可数名词”可以表示泛指，不定冠词a/an的泛指用法指的是某一类事物中任何一个具有代表性的成员，所以我们可以用any来替换a/an。
20. "The happiest women, like the happiest nations, have no history." - George Eliot, real name: Mary Ann Evens, English 19th century novelist. 最幸福的女人，像最幸福的民族一样，没有历史。特指
21.  "Non-violence is the article of my faith." - Mahatma Gandhi, 1869-1948, Indian statesman.
22. "Success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed." - Emily Dickinson, 19th century American poet.

# 不定冠词 a/an 的用法

## 不定冠词的泛指与非泛指用法

不定冠词仅用于限定单数可数名词。在用法上，当根据说话者和听话者的共有知识不能统一确认所指事物的时候，我们就会用a/an来修饰一个名词。所以，a/an通常用于所指事物在前面未曾提及并假定说话者或听话者对它还不熟悉的时候。

泛指的时候，一般仅限于处在主语位置的“a/an+单数名词”。如果“a/an+单数名词”是用在表语位置以及宾语位置，则失去了泛指的功能，而表现为其他的意义。

### 一、在主语有泛指功能

1. A tiger is a dangerous animal.
2. A child needs plenty of love.

### 二、在补足语中，表示分类，具有描述功能

1. Bill is an engineer.
2. This is a warm day.
3. The piece of apparatus is a Bunsen burner.
4. John is  teacher.

如果是独一无的，用 the 或者常常省去冠词。

### 三、用在宾语中，具有所指功能

## 不定冠词 a/an 与不可数名词

在三类名词（即单数名词、复数名词和不可数名词）当中，不定冠词仅用于限定单数可数名词，不可数名词的前面通常不用a/an。但是，出于特定的意义表达的需要，就要用a/an来限定不可数名词。

1. A washing powder I've found to be extremely good is "Snow".
2. This seems to be an excellent oil; the engine's running very smoothly.

### 一、很多不可数名词与a/an连用，是表示“一种”或“一类”

3. A cheese that I like is Camembert.

### 二、对于饮料类的不可数名词，与 a/an 连用时，是表示 “一杯” 这样的饮料

4. I'd like a beer, please.

### 三、有些不可数名词，当它们与a/an连用时，会有特别的意思，或者说意思会发生改变

a glass

an iron(铁) 可以表示一个电熨斗。

8. I ran over a chicken near a farm today. It had obviously escaped. 特指一只🐔

## 不定冠词a/an与数词one

不定冠词在历史上起源于非重读形式的one，在当代英语的许多语境中，不定冠词的这种数词功能仍是非常主要的。所以，在下列并列结构中，one可作为a的强调形式的等同词而替代a。

1. a mile or two
2. one or two miles



1. a foot and a half
2. one and a half feet

### 一、强调数量“一”时用one

1. Customer: When will they be ready?

   Assistant: They take a week.

   Customer: One week, right, thanks very much?

   顾客用one来强调数字“一”的概念，显然是为了加强语气，表示他认为一周时间有点长。译成汉语时，我们要表达出这种强调语气，比如译成“得一周啊”。

2. It was full of garlic. David took one mouthful and shot out of the room!

   强调就吃了一口大蒜🧄，整个房间都有味了。用 a 也行，但是没有强调作用。

### 二、因为one强调数量，所以常用于准确的对照数字

1. A hundred grams of flour to one egg,yeah, mixed up in the bowl.

2. two kilos of flour and one liter of water

### 三、讲故事中用one

1. There is one place we go to which is a Mexican restaurant, and they have a happy hour between 5:30. and 7:30.
2.  My parents slaved sixteen hours a day, yet we constantly were oppressed by debts and harassed by hard luck. One of my earliest memories is watching the flood waters of the102 River rolling over our corn and hayfields,destroying everything. The floods destroyed our crops six years out of seven. *One* year, thefloods didn't come. We raised a bumper corncrop, bought feed cattle, and fattened them with our corn. But the floods might just as well have drowned our corn that year, for the price of fat cattle fell on the Chicago market; and after feeding and fattening the cattle, we gotonly thirty dollars more for them than what we had paid for them. Thirty dollars for a whole year's work! ... *One* day as Father returned home from Maryville, he stopped his horses ona bridge crossing the 102 River, got off the wagon, and stood for a long time looking down at the water, debating with himself whether he should jump in and end it all.
3. One day you'll be sorry for what you are doing now.

### 四、表示类指意义的a/an不能换成one

语义会变

1. A shotgun is no good. 猎枪不行
2. One shotgun is no good. 一只猎枪不行。

### 五、表示度量的 a/an 不能换成 One

我们可以用a/an来表示度量，以表示价格、速度或比率等概念。这时的a/an相当于per（每，每一），不能换成one。

1. The rent is $100 a week.
2. The rent is $100 one week. ——这是错误的用法.



1. ten dollars a day.
2. $5 a kilo.
3. Four times a day.

### 六、表示数量的固定搭配中的 a 不能换成 one

a few, a little, a great many, a large number of.

### 不定冠词 a/an 与 this

在口头叙述中，当说话者想强调某个人、某个地方或某件事，并使他们变得更加生动时，就可以用this代替a。

A woman is telling a story about standing in the wrong queue for something.

1. So I go in this queue, and I'm waiting, so I saw them taking names and wrinting things down, so I had this feeling I was in the wrong place, so I thought to myself, "Oh, I'm going from here." But as I was standing at the table this person said, "Now then, you're next!"

2. First man: Apart from George she hasn't really met any nice people, eligible nice people I know of, perhaps I don't know enough.

   Second man: There was this guy that she was really madly in love with, that went on and ended up working on an oil rig somewhere.

   First man: Really?

   Second man: Oh yes, she really was, really loyal. Very struck on him.
以上讨论的是，在用非正式的语言进行叙述、讲故事、说笑话时，我们常用this代替a来指代一个特殊的中心话题。简言之，讲述事情或开玩笑时用this代替a/an。但请注意，**在正式的口语或书面语形式中不能使用这种说法**。

# 用/不用冠词的意义区别

在英文中，有一类表示家居生活和社会事业机构的名词，用不用冠词含义有区别。当我们不用冠词时，表示的是人们去这些地方做在这些地方应该做的事，或者说做的事情与这些地方密切相关。

1. His mother is in hospital and he has been in the hospital to take care of her. 前者表示生病住院，后者表示在医院里。

2. He is in prison for bribery. 

   He is often invited to the prison to give lectures.

### 家居生活类名词

在餐桌一般是吃饭，在床上一般是睡觉。

At table

At the table

go to bed

got to the bed

lie down on the bed

in bed

In the bed

### 处所、建筑物或社会事业机构

go to hospital 

redecorate the hospital

be in/at church

admire the church

### 关于上学

go to school

go to the school

### 关于 sea 的表达

go to sea（表示 “当海员” 或 “出差航行”）

go to the sea.

by sea （相当于 by ship，表示”乘船“）

by the sea 

in office（在职，上台执政）

in the office

behind time （“落后于时间”，即 “晚点了，迟到了”）

behind the time(s) （落后于时代）

in red（穿红色的衣服）

In the red（负债，亏损）

I'm not a. communist necessarily, but i've been in the red all my life.（我未必是共产主义者，但我一辈子都呆在“红色阵营” '即入不敷出'）。

美国民歌手伍迪·格思里（Woody Guthrie, American folksinger）

in front of （外部）

in the front of （内部）

Take place （固定的短语动词，表示“发生”）

take the place 代替

out of question（没有问题）相当于 no problem

Out of the question（完全不可能）

men

men of age 没有冠词修饰age，此时age具有抽象意义，of age就表示“够岁数了，成年了”，相当于old enough。

men of the age 有冠词an修饰age，此时age就是表示某个具体的年龄，所以of an age表示“同一个年龄”的意思。

不加 the 表示泛指，有泛指的意思，加了 the 表示特指某个具体的内容，所以两者意思会有出入。

20. Ken went to the prison to visit his brother because he was in prison for bribery.

21. There's a nice view from the window. You can see the sea.

22. It was a long voyage. We were at sea for weeks.

23. Jack is seaman. He spends most of his life at sea.

24. It is a nice day, isn't it?

    Yes, let's go for a walk by the sea.

# 其他使用冠词的场合

## 一、形容词或副词的最高级、序数词以及 only 用作形容词加名词连用时，它们的前面一般要用 the。

1. the only/best
2. the first

## 二、在乐器、乐团、合唱团及流行音乐团体前加 the

3. the Beatles “甲壳虫”乐队
4. the Philadelphia Orchestra费城管弦乐队
5. play/learn the guitar弹/学吉他
6. learn the piano学钢琴

## 三、定冠词the与姓氏连用

- the Kennedys
- the Bushes

## 四、表示强调时，会用the

Receptionist: So it's just one person then?

Customer: No, no, it's for the two of us.

Receptionist: Oh, I'm sorry. Right, two persons.

## 其他不用冠词的场合

## 一、关于职业、身份或头衔

如果这个职业头衔是独一无二的，或者说这个职位在一个单位里是唯一的，此时常不用冠词。不过，也可以用 the（既然是独一无二的身份，所以不可能用a/an）。

 I am an English teacher.

## 二、关于球类、棋类运动

16. play football

## 三、关于其他限定词与冠词

1. 冠词：the, an, a
2. 物主形容词：my, your, his, her, our, their
3. 指示形容词：this, that, these, those
4. 名词属格：Tom's, John's

所以下面这些表达都是错误的：

- the my book
- *Tom's the book*
- my the money
- *our the problems*

## 四、特殊名词

在下列这些特殊名词前不加the

- nature
- society
- space
- man
- history

## 关于星期

## 关于昼夜



# 数量限定词

## a few/a little

a few和few的后面只能接复数名词，而a little和little的后面只能接不可数名词。

a few和a little的意思是肯定的，相当于some，表示“有一些”的意思。而few和little的意思是否定的，表示“很少，几乎没有”。

只能说：only a little或only a few，而不能说：only few*或only little*。但为了强调否定意义，我们可说：very few或very little。

## some/any

肯定，否定。

any + 单数名词

- You can watch any bus. They all go to the railway station.

- You can ask any person over there. They all can tell you.

some + 单数名词

- Of the many ways of getting to prison, Soapy thought the best was to eat a big meal at some good   restaurant and then told the manager that he didn't have money to pay.
- Some person at the gate is asking to see you.
- I always just hoped that I'd meet some nice friendly girl, like the look of her, hope the look of me didn't make her physically sick, then pop the question and, um, settle down and be happy. It worked for my parents.

some的这一特殊用法可表示强烈的感情色彩，它往往暗示缺乏兴趣，甚至是蔑视的态度。

-  I don't want to spend my life in some lonely little village.

Some + 数词

大约，这一用法常常暗指这是一个给人以深刻印象的很大的数字。

- Some 1,500 passengers and crew died aboard the Titanic when it sank on April 14, 1912 after hitting an iceberg. It lies at at a depth of some 4,000 meters, some 640 kilometers south of Newfoundland, Canada.

# 个体限定词 each/every

后面只能接单数可数名词。

- Every boy has a gift.
- Each boy has a gift.
- Every man is the master of his own fortune.

each不仅用作限定词，而且也可用作代词；而every只能用作限定词。因此，each用作代词可以单独使用，而every只能与名词连用，不能单独使用。

- Each has a gift.

- Each of the boys has a gift.
- Every one of the boys has gift.
- The boys each have a gift.
- The boys have a gift each.

each可以用来指两个或两个以上的事物。而every却总是指三个或三个以上的事物，不能指两个；。

- Each sex has its own physical and psychological characteristics.
- There are a lot of trees on each side of thestreet.

each和every强调的重点不一样，可以将两者并列起来使用，说成each and every，既强调个体差别同时又强调整体。

 I want to welcome each and every balloonenthusiast in Philadelphia. Thank you forcoming here this morning to commemorate thefirst balloon voyage in the United States.

一般来说，each不与数词连用，而every可与数词连用，然后再加复数名词。

- every four years

# 个体限定词 another/other

从与名词的搭配来看，another不能修饰不可数名词及复数名词，只能与单数可数名词连用，表示不确定的“另一个”，“再一个”。

- another day
- other boys

数词要置于another的后面，但要放在other的前面。具体来说就是采用下面的结构：1．another+数词+复数名词2．数词+other+复数名词。

another three days另外三天

three other days另外三天

- We will stay here for another three days.
- I am always busy from Monday to Thursday, but I can come on three other days.

another+数词+名词复数”结构强调的是数量概念。比如another three days表示“接下来还有三天”，是一个量的累积。而“数词+other+复数名词”结构强调的是类别概念。比如three other days表示“其他三天”，说明的是特定的某三天，而不是一个数量的概念。

与“another+数词+名词复数”这一结构意思相同的另一种结构是：“数词+more+复数名词”

- one more time——Daft Punk（感觉不符合这个场景）
-  three more days

another不能与a连用，因此与a few搭配时，我们要说another few，而不能说another a few*。但如果与more连用，则要说成afew more，表示的意思完全一样。

- another few weeks/a few more weeks还有几个星期
- another few boys/a few more boys又有几个男孩

other

1．other之前可以有其他限定词修饰

 You can have everything in life you want if you'll just help enough other people to get what they want!如果你能帮助别人梦想成真，你自己也就可以心想事成！——Zig Ziglar（金·克拉）我的翻译：利他就是利己！！！

- every other day
- no other tools
- I have many other books for you to read

other/others

词尾不带-s的other只能作限定词来用，其后面必须接名词，而不能单独使用。比如不能说：otherare...*。与此相反，others只能用作代词，后面不能再接名词，而只能单独使用。

other/the other

这里是关于other与the other在含义上的区别的问题。“other+名词”表示不确定的“其他的，另外的”。若有了定冠词the限定，“the other+名词”则表示特定范围内的“剩下其余的”。

>  这是几年前在某个大学的毕业典礼上，可口可乐公司总裁布莱恩·戴森（Brian Dyson）说的一番话。这番话说明了我们应该处理好工作与生活其他方面的关系。当然，不同人有不同的选择。

> Image life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air. You name them - work, family, health, friends and spirit, and you're keeping all these ball in the air.
>
> You will soon understand that work is rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls are made of glass. If you drop one of these, it will be irrevocably scuffed（无法挽回的磨损）, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered（破碎了）. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.
>
> How?
>
> Don't undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others. It is because we are different that each of us is special. Don't set your goals by what other people deem important. Only you know what is best for you.



The grass on the other side always looks greener. While we are eyeing the grass on the other side, there are others who are eyeing the grass on your side. They would be happy to trade places with us.



# either/neither

二者都是与单数可数名词连用，谓语动词用单数。

这是二者作限定词的用法。此时，二者均不能再与其他的限定词（如冠词、物主代词或指示形容词等）连用。

- Either day is OK. 
- Neither day is OK. 

## 二者用代词

用作代词时，二者不直接接名词，而是单独使用或接of短语。

- Come over on Saturday or Sunday. Either is OK.
- You can't choose Choices A and B. Neitheris right.
- Either of the answers is right.
- Neither of my children has done that.

上面例句中，名词前面必须有限定词，名词必须用复数，谓语动词通常用单数。

## 词义差别

either有两个意思。首先，either的基本意思是“两个当中的任何一个”，这个或那个（one or the other）

neither只有一个意思，即“两者都不（not oneand not the other）”

## either... not相当于neither

- Either of the answers is not correct.
- Neither of the answers is correct.

# 限定词中的 “二”与“三”

## both & all

在英文中，both只表示“两者都”，而all表示“三个或三个以上都”。

- Both of us have learned English for a year.
- All of us have learned English for a year.

## neither & none

同上

- Neither of the twins was arrested, beacuse I saw both at a party last night.

## the other & another

the other ，the 有特指的意思，所以明确了的另一个，只有两个人的时候用。

another 不确定的另外一个，必然是指 “三个或三个以上的另一个”。

- He took her money in one hand and with the other hand he grasped her mitten.

## each & every

each表示两个或两个以上的“每一个”，而every表示从三个算起的“每一个”。

# 限定词与可数/不可数名词

1. **只与**单数可数名词搭配

   a, an, each, every, either, neither, another, one 等。

2. **只与**复数可数名词搭配的限定词

   both, few, a few, fewer, a number of, many, several, these, those, two 及 two 以上的基数词等。

3. **只与**不可数名词搭配的限定词

   little, a little, less, much, a bit of, a great amount/deal of 等。

4. 既可以与不可数名词也可以与复数可数名词搭配的限定词

   a lot of, lots of, plenty of, more, most 和 all 等等。

5. 同时与单数可数名词、复数可数名词和不可数名词均可搭配的限定词

   any, some, no, the 物主限定词（your、my 等），名词属格（Tom's、my mother's）等。

# 限定词 of 短语

数量或个体词+of+特指限定词+复数名词或不可数名词。

特指限定词分四类

1. 指示限定词 this, that, these and those.
2. 物主限定词 my, your, his, hew, its, their and our.
3. 名词所有格 Mike's, Mary's and the teacher's.
4. 定冠词 the 

## all/most/some/any of + 特指限定词+复数可数或不可数名词

- Most of my/these/the/John's books are interesting.

## many/a few/few/several/both/two/three of + 特指限定词+复数可数名词

- Many of these students are good at English.

这里去掉 these 是错误的。要特指，特指。

## much/a little/little of +特指限定词+不可数名词

- Much of the water is wasted.

注意，其他本身就带有of的数量词如a lot of, lots of, a couple of, plenty of, a number of 和a great deal of等，则必须直接与名词连用，名词的前面不需要加特指限定词修饰。

a lot of books.

a great deal of water

a couple of days

## 特别关注 all 和 both

- All students are smart.
- All of my students are smart.
- All my students are smart.



- Both students are smart.
- Both of my students are smart.
- Both my students are smart.

## 特别关注：不定代词与of短语

不定代词 none, someone, anyone以及everyone，都是两个词合起来写成的一个词。它们还分别有分开写的形式：no one, some one, any one以及every one，都是两个词构成的不定代词。它们与of短语的搭配关系不同。

<table>
    <thead>
    	<tr>
            <th>none + of 语句</th>
            <th>no one + of 语句</th>
            <th>例句</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                someone<br/>
                anyone 不接 of 语句<br/>
                everyone
            </td>
            <td>
                some one<br/>
                any one + of 语句<br/>
                every one
            </td>
            <td>
                Every is here<br/>
                Every one of us has a gift<br/>
                None of us has a gift
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

合起来的不加，分开的加。特殊情况 no one 接，none 要接。

- None of us has gift.
- Every one of us has a gift.
- Some one of us has a gift.
- Some one of us has a gift.
- Any one of us has gift.

练习的重点是，some/all/many + of + 限定词（my，those 等） + 复数

# 限定词总结

根据限定词在名词前的位置关系

- 前位限定词（pre-determiner）
- 中位限定词（central determiner）
- 后位限定词（post-determiner）

e.g.

1. I met all my many friend.
2. They questioned both the last two boys.

## 一、前位限定词

1. 种类

说明名词的数量，主要有三种。

表示倍数关系

- half my salary
- twice my salary
- double my salary
- three times my salary

表示几分之几

- one third my salary
- Two-thirds my salary

个体形容词

- all my salary
- both my salaries

共存性

前位限定词一般互相排斥，不能共存。下面就是错误的。

- All half my salary
- Half double her income.

## 二、中位限定词

1. 种类

   1. 冠词 the, an, a

       All the book. 

      Half an hour. 

      Twice the size. 

      All my money. 

      All his. money.   

   2. 物主形容词：my,  your, his, our. their

      All my money

      all his money

   3. 特指形容词：this, that, these 和 those

      all these problems

      twice that size

      Four times this amount

   4. 名词所属格 ：John‘s, his father's

      all John's money 

2. 共存性

   中位限定词也彼此排斥

## 后位限定词

种类

1. 基数词或序数词：one/first, two/second,three/third和four/fourth等。

- the two children
- his fourth birthday

2. 一般序数词

next, last, past, previous,subsequent, other和another等

- My next plan
- our last meeting
- your previous mistakes
- Her subsequent response.

3. 数量限定词

few, many, several, little, less和more等

- my many friends
- our several achievements
- the few friends that I have

共存性

后位限定词可以同时出现在名词前。

my next two plans

Several other people

也有先后问题，一般采用下面顺序。

1. 序数词/一般序数词+基数词。

   The first two weeks

   During the next 50 years

2. 序数词/一般序数词+数量限定词。

   During the past few years

3. 一般序数词与基数词的位置关系

   Two  other people

   many other people
