9. The Farmer and the Donkey.

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At fist, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was **astonished** at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbeors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the **edge** of the well and **trotted** off!

*Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!* 确实确实

# 一般过去时

据说，在美国的新闻报道中，最精练简明的导语出现在1906年4月的旧金山大地震之时，这个导语是：

1. San Francisco Was

这里除了地名San Francisco外，就只有唯一的一个关键词was，通过was表明了这次地震对旧金山所造成的破坏程度——已将其夷为平地，该城市不复存在了。因此，这个导语不妨译成：旧金山已成为过去

was \$60 now 50\$，原价 60，现价 50

7. An American visiting England walked into a hotel lobby and pushed a button for elevator service. "The lift will be down presently," said a nearby clerk.

   "The lift?" Said the American. "Oh, you mean the elevator."

   "No, I mean the lift," replied the Englishman, annoyed by the American's arrogance.

   "I think I should know what it's called," said the American. "After all, elevators were invented in the United States."

   "Perhaps," retorted the Englishman. "But the language was invented here."
