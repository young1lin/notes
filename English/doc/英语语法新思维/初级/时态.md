9. The Farmer and the Donkey.

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At fist, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was **astonished** at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbeors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the **edge** of the well and **trotted** off!

*Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!* 确实确实

# 一般过去时

据说，在美国的新闻报道中，最精练简明的导语出现在1906年4月的旧金山大地震之时，这个导语是：

1. San Francisco Was

这里除了地名San Francisco外，就只有唯一的一个关键词was，通过was表明了这次地震对旧金山所造成的破坏程度——已将其夷为平地，该城市不复存在了。因此，这个导语不妨译成：旧金山已成为过去

was \$60 now 50\$，原价 60，现价 50

用法

1. 过去发生的短暂的动作或状态

   一般过去时常表示在过去某一个特定的时间所发生的动作或存在的状态，此时常和表示过去的特定的时间状语连用。这些时间状语有：yesterday,yesterday evening, last night, the night beforelast（前天晚上），last year, last spring（去年春天）以及three days/months/years ago等等

2. 过去发生的重复或延续活动

3. 一般过去时和现在完成时用于 for + 时间段的区别



### 过去发生的的短暂的动作或状态

1. I saw him in the library yesterday morning.

2. I began to learn English ten years ago.

3. I bought this computer three years ago.

4. He was late for school this morning.

5. I was tried last night, so I went to bed early.

6. The local shopping mall sells everything frmo tires to funa fish. I was there around noon and stopped at the lunch counter for a slice of pizza. I ate only half of it and threw my leftovers in a nearby trash can. Then I turned to see a man standing there, hot dog in one hand, ketchup in the other, with a look of horror on his face. I asked him what was wrong. He said, "I just purchased that trash can!"

7. An American visiting England walked into a hotel lobby and pushed a button for elevator service. "The lift will be down presently," said a nearby clerk.

   "The lift?" Said the American. "Oh, you mean the elevator."

   "No, I mean the lift," replied the Englishman, annoyed by the American's arrogance.

   "I think I should know what it's called," said the American. "After all, elevators were invented in the United States."

   "Perhaps," retorted the Englishman. "But the language was invented here."

8. I didn't choose this life; it chose me. 这是巴基斯坦反对派领袖、前总理贝·布托（Bhutto）在其回忆录中的一句话。
### 过去发生的重复或延续活动

a specific period of time in the past

延续

1.  I slept for eight hours last night.
2. She lived in our town for three years, but now she is living in Beijing.
3. I lived in the country for ten years.

重复

1. I wrote a letter once a week to my family when I was in my firs college year.
2. He used to do morning exercises.
3. He took a walk after supper when he was alive.



### 一般过去时、现在完成时用于 “for + 时间段” 的区别

一般过去时与“for+时间段”连用，表示动作在过去已经结束，并没有延续到现在；而现在完成时与“for+时间段”连用，则表明动作延续到现在，并且还有可能延续下去。

加了 have/has 的，就是直到现在的，没加，就是不到现在的。

我忘记还可以说成 It slipped my mind.

1. A: Did you pick up my books from Ron's house?

   B: Sorry. It slipped my mind.

### 一般将来时——预测、计划和意愿

从是否成为事实的角度（factual or non-factual）来看。将来的事情与发生在过去或现在的事情是完全不同的，发生在过去或现在的事情都已是确定无疑的，是一个事实（fact）。但谈论将来要发生的事情，就不可能成为一个确定无疑的事实，而只能是表示一种可能性（Situations in thefuture are treated differently. They areinherently non-factual, but can be consideredas either relatively certain or relatively unlikelyor even impossible. Thus future events are nottreated as facts, hence are onlypossibilities.）。所以，从核心意义的角度来说，发生在“将来”的事件与发生在“过去”或“现在”的事件不可能有相同的确信度（certainty）。

will用来表示很有把握的预测（prediction），但不是对事实的叙述或报告。

be going to 表示将来——预测，比 will you更多的证据支持，而且事件发生的时间更近。还有预先计划好的。打算

will 更多表达主观猜测，当机立断的决定。

- You'll feel better if you take this medicine.

当机立断的决定，我们只能用will来表达。这一般是表示说话人事先并不知道，而是随着谈话的进展，在得知了新的信息之后才做出的某个决定。这不是在“预测”，也不是在“预先计划”。

will这种表示“意愿”的意义，若用于第二人称（you）的一般疑问句（Will you?）中，则可以用来提出“请求”。

Mr. Hillcock: I'm going to show you something, Mrs. Gump. Now here is normal.Forrest is right here. The State requires aminimum IQ of 80 to attend public school, Mrs.Gump. He's going to have to go to a specialschool. He'll be just fine.Mrs. Gump: What does normal mean, anyway?He might be a bit on the slow side, but myboy, Forrest, is going to get the sameopportunities as everyone else. He's not goingto **some special school** to learn how to retreadtires. We're talking about 5 little points here.There must be something can be done.

之前学的限定词的特殊用法。will 就是“当机立断（spontaneous decision）”，而不是事先计划好的（unplanned）。

Be going to 有表决心的感情色彩。

e.g. 

- We're going to become the world's leading forwarding company.

# 现在进行时表示将来

be doing 

You use this tense if the action is part of a schedule or it's a definite plan. Use it when you have already made a decision, and have "put it in your diary".

When we talk about things in the future that are not definite, we use "am going to + verb". This is more certain than expressions like "hope to...", "might..." or "would like to..."。

# 一般现在时表示将来

A: My daughter gets married at three o'clock in St.Mary's Church on Saturday.

B: How do you feel about it?
A: Well, I'm losing a daughter but I am gaining a telephone.

# 其他表示将来的句型结构

## be to do

1．表示已安排好要在将来发生的事，是比较正式的用法

- They are to go on a strike on July 8th.
- She is to be married next month.
- The Premier is to visit Australia next month.

2．表示强烈的命令，相当于must, should

- You are to finish your homework before you go to play.
- The form is to be filled out in ink and returned this week.
- These tablets are not to be taken orally.
- The parties involved are to sign the agreement.
- If if doesn't rain within the next few weeks, the crops will have to be watered if they are to survive.

# 进行时态

continuous tense

- Be doing

1. 现在进行时（the present continuous tense）
2. 过去进行时（the past continuous tense）
3. 将来进行时（the future continuous tense）
4. 过去将来进行时（Past Future continuous）

因为英语分 4 个时（tense），和 4 个态（aspect）

**现在进行时**

I am doing

He/She/It is doing

We/You/They are doing

**过去进行时**

I/He/She was doing

We/You/They were doing

**将来进行时**

will be doing

进行时，就是 be + doing，也有用进行时表将来语态的，详情见上面。

有三种意思。
1. 想象自己或其他人在将来的某一特定时刻正在做某事；
2. 表示计划好的事；
3. 表示背景动作。提供另一个段动作发生的事件背景。


“将来进行时态（will bedoing）”的一种很有用的用法，即我们用它来“礼貌地询问”，显得比一般将来时will do更委婉客气。这是因为will be doing常表示很客观地询问事实，并不想干涉对方的决定；而will do往往带有各种感情色彩，如请求、命令、指示、质问甚或威胁等等。


1. 进行时态往往和某一特定的时间点连用，来表示某一个活动在该时刻正在进行。
   1. 给出具体时间
      1. I'm listening to the English program right now.
      2. I will be watching CCTV news at this time tomorrow evening.
   2. 通过另一活动表达这一特定时刻
      1. I was watching CCTV news when he arrived.
      2. I will be studying English when you come tomorrow.
2. 语境
   1. 好朋友间的交谈
   2. 朋友间的私人信件
   3. 经济学课本

e.g.
How will you be paying for this？

How will you pay for this?

## 现在进行时

1. action happening exactly 说话时刻正在进行的动作
2. Action happening around now 目前一段时期内持续的一种暂时的情况
   1. The action may not be happening exactly now, but it is happening just before and just after now, and it is not permanent or habitual.
3. 用于表示“改变”的动词，强调“逐渐变化”的过程
   1. It is getting crowded.
   2. It is getting better.
   3. His health is deteriorating.

Exercise 8.2.1-3 （Key） 第七题

8.3.4 口语用法：表示委婉的请求或提建议

要带个时间，或者地点，或者上下文中有时间，用过去进行时。

Exercise 8.4.4
翻译, 差别
1. Will you be bringing the piano in here?
   Will you please bring the piano in here?
2. Will you be joining us for dinner?
   Will you join use for dinner?
   

填空
How will you be living in the **dormitory** this year?

will be doing 表示客观的
will do 表示主观的

Mary won't be paying this bill.
我想玛丽不会付账的
Mary won't pay this bill.
玛丽不愿意付账，她拒绝付账。
He won't resign.
他拒绝辞职
He won't be resigning.
我想他不会辞职

Exercise 8.4.5
翻译
1. He won't be coming to the party. 我想他可能不会来参加聚会
   He won't come to the party. 他不愿参加这个聚会。
2. I will be helping Jenny with her English tomorrow.  我明天要帮珍妮辅导英文。
   Don't worry. I will help you with your English. 别担心，我会帮你辅导英文的
3. I don't think I will be meeting him tonight.
   I don't think I will meet him tonight.
4. We'll be flying at 30,000 feet.
   We'll fly at 30,000 feet.
   

将来进行时态will bedoing可能有下列五种意义和用法：
1．想象自己或其他人在将来某一特定的时刻正在做某事；
2．表示计划好的事；
3．表示背景动作。提供另外一个短动作发生的事件背景；
4．用在疑问句中，表示客气的询问。这一用法在口语中尤为常见；
5．用will be doing来表示客观的将来，以避免与表示“意愿”的will do混淆。

Exercise 8.4
1. will be having
2. will you be doing
3. will be doing 
4. will be attending（表示客观的将来会发生的事情）
5. will be not staying, will be staying
6. will be waiting
7. will be not sitting 
8. will be studying（表示计划好的事）
9. will be flying

He is not going to resign.
He won't resign.
He won't be resigning.



# 分析进行时的思维特征

一般时态只有时（tense）的变化，而没有态（aspect）的变化，因此把一般时态称为零体动作。

|      Tense      | Modal  |  Aspect  | Verb |
| :-------------: | :----: | :------: | :--: |
| PAST or PRESENT | (WILL) | BE + ING | VERB |

“语法体（grammatical aspect）”和“动词体（lexical aspect）”两方面是相互作用的，二者的共同作用不仅影响到时态的正确使用，同时也深刻地影响着对句子意思的理解（It is important tobe aware of how the interaction of lexical andgrammatical aspect is typically interpreted.）所以，我们不仅要理解“语法体”的核心意义，同时还要结合“动词体”的特点，要考虑动词的不同选择对“语法体”的意义的影响，只有这样才能真正地理解和使用英语时态，从而造出正确的句子。

## 进行时态的核心含义

“语法体（grammatical aspect），进行动作的核心意义在于表示：

1．事件具有持续性（ongoing）：进行时态首先表示的是一个事件或活动在某个特定的时间正在持续；

2．事件具有短暂性（temporary）：即表明事件的持续时间是有限的。如果是无限的，即表达一个长期的、恒久的含义，那么就该用一般现在时态了；

3．事件未完成（incomplete）：进行体既然强调动作的持续性，那么就表明这个动作还没有结束。
