9. The Farmer and the Donkey.

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At fist, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was **astonished** at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbeors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the **edge** of the well and **trotted** off!

*Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!* 确实确实

# 一般过去时

据说，在美国的新闻报道中，最精练简明的导语出现在1906年4月的旧金山大地震之时，这个导语是：

1. San Francisco Was

这里除了地名San Francisco外，就只有唯一的一个关键词was，通过was表明了这次地震对旧金山所造成的破坏程度——已将其夷为平地，该城市不复存在了。因此，这个导语不妨译成：旧金山已成为过去

was \$60 now 50\$，原价 60，现价 50

用法

1. 过去发生的短暂的动作或状态

   一般过去时常表示在过去某一个特定的时间所发生的动作或存在的状态，此时常和表示过去的特定的时间状语连用。这些时间状语有：yesterday,yesterday evening, last night, the night beforelast（前天晚上），last year, last spring（去年春天）以及three days/months/years ago等等

2. 过去发生的重复或延续活动

3. 一般过去时和现在完成时用于 for + 时间段的区别



### 过去发生的的短暂的动作或状态

1. I saw him in the library yesterday morning.

2. I began to learn English ten years ago.

3. I bought this computer three years ago.

4. He was late for school this morning.

5. I was tried last night, so I went to bed early.

6. The local shopping mall sells everything frmo tires to funa fish. I was there around noon and stopped at the lunch counter for a slice of pizza. I ate only half of it and threw my leftovers in a nearby trash can. Then I turned to see a man standing there, hot dog in one hand, ketchup in the other, with a look of horror on his face. I asked him what was wrong. He said, "I just purchased that trash can!"

7. An American visiting England walked into a hotel lobby and pushed a button for elevator service. "The lift will be down presently," said a nearby clerk.

   "The lift?" Said the American. "Oh, you mean the elevator."

   "No, I mean the lift," replied the Englishman, annoyed by the American's arrogance.

   "I think I should know what it's called," said the American. "After all, elevators were invented in the United States."

   "Perhaps," retorted the Englishman. "But the language was invented here."

8. I didn't choose this life; it chose me. 这是巴基斯坦反对派领袖、前总理贝·布托（Bhutto）在其回忆录中的一句话。
### 过去发生的重复或延续活动

a specific period of time in the past

延续

1.  I slept for eight hours last night.
2. She lived in our town for three years, but now she is living in Beijing.
3. I lived in the country for ten years.

重复

1. I wrote a letter once a week to my family when I was in my firs college year.
2. He used to do morning exercises.
3. He took a walk after supper when he was alive.



### 一般过去时、现在完成时用于 “for + 时间段” 的区别

一般过去时与“for+时间段”连用，表示动作在过去已经结束，并没有延续到现在；而现在完成时与“for+时间段”连用，则表明动作延续到现在，并且还有可能延续下去。

加了 have/has 的，就是直到现在的，没加，就是不到现在的。

我忘记还可以说成 It slipped my mind.

1. A: Did you pick up my books from Ron's house?

   B: Sorry. It slipped my mind.

### 一般将来时——预测、计划和意愿

从是否成为事实的角度（factual or non-factual）来看。将来的事情与发生在过去或现在的事情是完全不同的，发生在过去或现在的事情都已是确定无疑的，是一个事实（fact）。但谈论将来要发生的事情，就不可能成为一个确定无疑的事实，而只能是表示一种可能性（Situations in thefuture are treated differently. They areinherently non-factual, but can be consideredas either relatively certain or relatively unlikelyor even impossible. Thus future events are nottreated as facts, hence are onlypossibilities.）。所以，从核心意义的角度来说，发生在“将来”的事件与发生在“过去”或“现在”的事件不可能有相同的确信度（certainty）。

will用来表示很有把握的预测（prediction），但不是对事实的叙述或报告。

be going to 表示将来——预测，比 will you更多的证据支持，而且事件发生的时间更近。

will 更多表达主观猜测。

- You'll feel better if you take this medicine.
