One day when I was walking down the street. I saw a fluffy, smiling, and snow-white Samoyed.

It was so adorable. At that point, I would've killed for a pet.

When I think of pets, I think of dogs, cats, and maybe birds, while there are people who might raise lizards, snakes, and even spiders as pets.

For me, cats and dogs are both great. They can help improve your mood and you can play with them.

When you pet them, you just feel your heart melt.

I would rank dogs far above cats though, cuz I'm not confident in my ability to bathe a cat or clip nails without depressing it or hurting myself.

However, If I had a dog, I would have to walk it several times a day, which is kind of annoying for a lazy or busy person.

I think it should be a serious decision.

If you're not confident in keeping one right now, don't rush.

If you already have one, just take good care of it.
