His name is Chris and he's my teacher. He spent some of childhood years in Honduras. 

Chris is typical Honduran. Honduran people love music, and they're very outgoing and enthusiastic. 

He has a lot of precious memories about playing soccer on almost every street corner when he was young.

He couldn't play soccer that anymore, 'casuse many of his friends moved to other places.
