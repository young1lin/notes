Today I'm gonna visit a friend. He lives out of DC, so it's about a 2-hour drive.

All right, first I gotta buckle up, then I gotta put the address in the GPS, make sure I don't get lost.

It says I need to go straight along Rhode Island Ave. first. Then I'll turn left onto 9th St.

After that, I gotta head south and I'm gonna take the I-395 Express Lane because there's less traffic.

Finally, I'll automatically switch from 395 onto the I-95 Express Lane as 395 ends here.

Traffic looks so much better here than in Beijing.

It easily takes me hours to drive somewhere in Beijing as it's always too packed on the road.

Here I am! I'm gonna park right there. Perfect!

It's very convenient indeed.

However, GPS also has its downsides, like lack of accuracy sometimes and privacy issues.
