I can't wait to venture to Bhutan.

He ventured to an island.

"Hey, how have you been?"

"Good. You?"

"Great. Hey, I've been thinking of going on a trip after this quarantine. What do think?"

"Hell yeah I'm on board. Where do you wanna go ?"

"Not sure yet...Bhutan?"

"...How come?"

"Just try to figure out places I've never ventured into."

"I kind of prefer somewhere nearby. 'Cause the whole airline situation is still kind of unstable."

"Hmmm...let's flip a coin."

"Yeah, we can call it in the air. But, when's the quarantine gonna be over though?"

"...It will be. Sooner or later."

Anyway, I hope all of us will get through the pandemic as soon as possible.

Then we can travel around the world again.
