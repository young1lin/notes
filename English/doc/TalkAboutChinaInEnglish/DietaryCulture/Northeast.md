# Preface
The northeast of China brings to mind images of fertile land, uncontaminated pastures, and vast plains. It abounds with a variety of crops, mountain products, and aquatic products. It has long rigid winters and is sparsely populated. Since ancient times, there lived a lot of ethnic groups. People there are fond of stewed dishes for high caloric intake against the rigid winters. It is their tradition to consume sacallion and garlic, frozen food, or preserved food. Frozen food and fruits can help boost the intake of vitamins and prevent scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin deficiency. People there are so fond of frozen food that the selling season of popsicles is the winter. Scallion and garlic are good for the treatment of indigestion and bacterial infection. Every household keeps jars for making and keeping preserved vegetables or paste as fresh vegetables are scarce in winter. 

Over time, people there gradually adapt to the strong flavor as the preserved vegetables have to be heavily salted in order not to go bad. Since the middle of the Qing Dynasty, increasing numbers of pioneers have immigrated to the north of the Shanhaiguan Pass to reclaim and cultivate the land. Nomadic lifestyle and gathering gave way to agriculture which became the major mode of production and diet patterns changed accordingly.

Features: The food generally has mixed flavors in one dish that tastes distinctly salty or sweet. Thoroughly cooked and savored with a great variety of ingredients with a fresh color. Common cooking methods include: sauteed, stir-fried, braised, deep-fried, roasted, steamed, and stewed, among which sauteed, deep-fried, braised, and stewed dishes are characteristic of the northeast diet.

Classic dishes: Braised Pork with Vermicelli, Fried Pork in [Scoop](Fisrt.md#Test), Mixed Stew, Hot Candied Sweet Potatoes, etc.
