As for the potential for evolutionary adaptation in marine birds, the document mentions that marine birds are vulnerable to phenological shifts in food-web dynamics, as they have limited phenotypic plasticity of reproductive timing, which suggests there is potentially little scope for evolutionary adaptation.

However, there is limited evidence to assess their present global impact on harvests. The North American Pacific Coast shellfish aquaculture industry experienced substantial economic losses in the 2000s, which is the clearest example of human harm from ocean acidification. Technology-based adaptations have been used to minimize aquaculture losses from ocean acidification. Climate change is also expected to alter marine organisms' contribution to climate regulation. Furthermore, global warming compromises seafood safety through human exposure to elevated bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants and mercury in marine plants and animals, increasing prevalence of waterborne Vibrio sp. pathogens, and heightened likelihood of harmful algal blooms. These risks are projected to be particularly large for human communities with high consumption of seafood, including coastal Indigenous communities, and for economic sectors such as fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism.
